In a judicial review, a court may invalidate laws, acts, or governmental actions that are incompatible with a higher authority. For example, an executive decision may be invalidated for being unlawful, or a statute may be invalidated for violating the terms of a constitution. Judicial review is one of the checks and balances in the separation of powers—the power of the judiciary to supervise (judicial supervision) the legislative and executive branches when the latter exceed their authority. The doctrine varies between jurisdictions, so the procedure and scope of judicial review may differ between and within countries. The judiciary in United States has been described as having unusually strong powers of judicial review from a comparative perspective. == General principles == Judicial review can be understood in the context of two distinct—but parallel—legal systems, civil law and common law, and also by two distinct theories of democracy regarding the manner in which government should be organized with respect to the principles and doctrines of legislative supremacy and the separation of powers. First, two distinct legal systems, civil law and common law, have different views about judicial review. Common-law judges are seen as sources of law, capable of creating new legal principles, and also capable of rejecting legal principles that are no longer valid. In the civil-law tradition, judges are seen as those who apply the law, with no power to create (or destroy) legal principles. Secondly, the idea of separation of powers is another theory about how a democratic society's government should be organized. In contrast to legislative supremacy, the idea of separation of powers was first introduced by Montesquieu; it was later institutionalized in the United States by the Supreme Court's ruling in Marbury v. Madison that the court had the power of judicial review to enforce the separation of powers stated in the US Constitution. This was left uncontested by the U.S. Congress and president Thomas Jefferson, despite his expressed opposition to the principle of judicial review by an unelected body. Separation of powers is based on the idea that no branch of government should be able to exert power over any other branch without due process of law; each branch of government should have a check on the powers of the other branches of government, thus creating a regulative balance among all branches of government. The key to this idea is checks and balances. In the United States, judicial review is considered a key check on the powers of the other two branches of government by the judiciary. Differences in organizing democratic societies led to different views regarding judicial review, with societies based on common law and those stressing a separation of powers being the most likely to utilize judicial review. Nevertheless, many countries whose legal systems are based on the idea of legislative supremacy have gradually adopted or expanded the scope of judicial review, including countries from both the civil law and common law traditions. Another reason why judicial review should be understood in the context of both the development of two distinct legal systems (civil law and common law) and two theories of democracy (legislative supremacy and separation of powers) is that some countries with common-law systems do not have judicial review of primary legislation. Though a common-law system is present in the United Kingdom, the country still has a strong attachment to the idea of legislative supremacy; consequently, judges in the United Kingdom do not have the power to strike down primary legislation. However, when the United Kingdom became a member of the European Union there was tension between its tendency toward legislative supremacy and the EU's legal system, which specifically gives the Court of Justice of the European Union the power of judicial review. === Principles of review === When carrying out judicial review a court may ensure that the principle of ultra vires are followed, that a public body's actions do not exceed the powers given to them by legislation. The decisions of administrative acts by public bodies under judicial review are not necessarily controlled in the same way that judicial decisions are, rather a court will enforce that principles of procedural fairness are followed when making judicial decisions. == Types == === Review of administrative acts and secondary legislation === Most modern legal systems allow the courts to review administrative \"acts\" (individual decisions of a public body, such as a decision to grant a subsidy or to withdraw a residence permit). In most systems, this also includes review of secondary legislation (legally enforceable rules of general applicability adopted by administrative bodies). Some countries (notably France and Germany) have implemented a system of administrative courts which are charged with resolving disputes between members of the public and the administration, regardless these courts are part of administration (France) or judiciary (Germany). In other countries (including the United States and United Kingdom), judicial review is carried out by regular civil courts although it may be delegated to specialized panels within these courts (such as the Administrative Court within the High Court of England and Wales). The United States employs a mixed system in which some administrative decisions are reviewed by the United States district courts (which are the general trial courts), some are reviewed directly by the United States courts of appeals and others are reviewed by specialized tribunals such as the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (which, despite its name, is not technically part of the federal judicial branch). It is quite common that before a request for judicial review of an administrative act is filed with a court, certain preliminary conditions (such as a complaint to the authority itself) must be fulfilled. In most countries, the courts apply special procedures in administrative cases. === Review of primary legislation === There are three broad approaches to judicial review of the constitutionality of primary legislation—that is, laws passed directly by an elected legislature. ==== No review by any courts ==== Some countries do not permit a review of the validity of primary legislation. In the United Kingdom, Acts of Parliament cannot be set aside under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, whereas Orders in Council, another type of primary legislation not passed by Parliament, can (see Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service (1985) and Miller/Cherry (2019)). Another example is the Netherlands, where the constitution expressly forbids the courts to rule on the question of constitutionality of primary legislation passed by the Dutch legislature or States-General. ==== Review by general courts ==== In countries which have inherited the English common law system of courts of general jurisdiction, judicial review is generally done by those courts, rather than specialised courts. Australia, Canada and the United States are all examples of this approach. In the United States, federal and state courts (at all levels, both appellate and trial) are able to review and declare the \"constitutionality\", or agreement with the Constitution (or lack thereof) of legislation by a process of judicial interpretation that is relevant to any case properly within their jurisdiction. In American legal language, \"judicial review\" refers primarily to the adjudication of the constitutionality of statutes, especially by the Supreme Court of the United States. Courts in the United States may also invoke judicial review in order to ensure that a statute is not depriving individuals of their constitutional rights. This is commonly held to have been established in the case of Marbury v. Madison, which was argued before the Supreme Court in 1803. Judicial review in Canada and Australia pre-dates their establishment as countries, in 1867 and 1901, respectively. The British Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 provided that a British colony could not enact laws which altered provisions of British laws which applied directly to the colony. Since the constitutions of Canada and Australia were enacted by the British Parliament, laws passed by governments in Australia and Canada had to be consistent with those constitutional provisions. More recently, the principle of judicial review flows from supremacy clauses in their constitutions. In Australia, the term 'judicial review' generally refers to reviews of the lawfulness of the actions of the executive and the public service, while reviews of the compatibility of laws with the Australian Constitution is known as characterisation or constitutional challenges. ==== Review by a specialized court ==== In 1920, Czechoslovakia adopted a system of judicial review by a specialized court, the Constitutional Court as written by Hans Kelsen, a leading jurist of the time. This system was also adopted the same time by Austria and became known as the Austrian System, also under the primary authorship of Hans Kelsen, being emulated by a number of other countries. In these systems, other courts are not competent to question the constitutionality of primary legislation; they often may, however, initiate the process of review by the Constitutional Court. Russia adopts a mixed model since (as in the US) courts at all levels, both federal and state, are empowered to review primary legislation and declare its constitutionality; as in the Czech Republic, there is a constitutional court in charge of reviewing the constitutionality of primary legislation. The difference is that in the first case, the decision about the law's adequacy to the Russian Constitution only binds the parties to the lawsuit; in the second, the Court's decision must be followed by judges and government officials at all levels. == History == Judicial review as a contribution to political theory is sometimes said to be a \"distinctively American contribution\", argued to have been established in the US Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison (1803). However, \"the American version of judicial review was the logical result of centuries of European thought and colonial experience which had made Western [societies] generally willing to admit the theoretical primacy of certain kinds of law and had made Americans in particular ready to provide a judicial means of enforcing that primacy.\" That is, the \"belief in the need to subordinate certain acts of the law-making power to higher, more permanent principles\" can be seen, for example, in medieval European scholastics, courts of equity in England, Parlements in France, and Enlightenment philosophers. Moreover, writing in 2005, Treanor argued that \"judicial review was much better established in the years immediately after the adoption of the [United States] constitution than has previously been recognized, and it was far from rare ... [and] judicial invalidation of statutes fell into certain patterns.\" US Chief Justice John Marshall, the author of Marbury v. Madison, \"came from Virginia, the state in which [judicial review] was particularly well established by the case law and in which it was repeatedly endorsed during the debate over the Constitution\", and thus, on a personal level, Marshall \"must have experienced judicial review as long-established\". Moreover, \"The fact that judicial review was exercised much more frequently than previously recognized in the years before Marbury helps explain why Marshall's assertion of the power to exercise judicial review in the case elicited so little comment.\" == In specific jurisdictions == == See also == Constitutional review Judicial Appeal Judicial activism Living Constitution Originalism Unconstitutional constitutional amendment Judicial reform == References == == Further reading == Edward S.

In contrast, the United Kingdom has a strong attachment to legislative supremacy, which means its judges do not have the power to strike down primary legislation, even though it is also a common-law country.",

        "question": "How do the systems for judicial review of administrative acts in France and Germany differ from those in the United States and the United Kingdom?",
        "answer": "France and Germany have implemented a system of specialized administrative courts to resolve disputes between the public and the administration. In contrast, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom use regular civil courts to carry out judicial review, although these may delegate cases to specialized panels within those courts.",

        "question": "What evidence suggests that the concept and practice of judicial review existed before the Supreme Court's 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison?",
        "answer": "The concept of judicial review has theoretical roots in centuries of European thought, including medieval scholastics, English courts of equity, and French Parlements, which promoted the idea of subordinating law-making to higher principles. Furthermore, in the period between the adoption of the U.S. Constitution and the Marbury decision, the practice of judicial review was already well-established and frequently exercised in the states, such as Virginia. The pre-existing familiarity with the practice helps explain why the Supreme Court's assertion of this power in Marbury v. Madison elicited little comment.",
