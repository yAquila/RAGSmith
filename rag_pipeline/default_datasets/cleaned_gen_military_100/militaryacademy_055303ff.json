It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned. Three types of academy exist: pre-collegiate-level institutions awarding academic qualifications, university-level institutions awarding bachelor's-degree-level qualifications, and those preparing officer cadets for commissioning into the armed services of the state. A naval academy is either a type of military academy (in the broad sense of that term) or is distinguished from one (in the narrow sense). In U.S. usage, the Military, Merchant Marine, Naval, Coast Guard, and the Air Force Academy serve as military academies under the categorization of service academies in that country. == History == The first military academies were established in the 18th century to provide future officers for technically specialized corps, such as military engineers and artillery, with scientific training. The Italian Military Academy was inaugurated in Turin on January 1, 1678, as the Savoy Royal Academy, making it the oldest military academy in existence. The Royal Danish Naval Academy was set up in 1701. The Royal Military Academy, Woolwich was set up in 1741, after a false start in 1720 because of a lack of funds, as the earliest military academy in Britain. Its original purpose was to train cadets entering the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. In France, the École Royale du Génie at Mézières was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the École Royale Militaire offering a general military education to the nobility. French military academies were widely copied in Prussia, Austria, Russia. The Norwegian Military Academy in Oslo, educates officers of the Norwegian Army. The academy was established in 1750, and is the oldest institution for higher education in Norway. By the turn of the century, under the impetus of the Napoleonic Wars and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions: to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission. The Kriegsakademie in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the École Royale Militaire of the Ancien Régime (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from). The Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England was the brainchild of John Le Marchant in 1801, who established schools for the military instruction of officers at High Wycombe and Great Marlow, with a grant of £30,000 from Parliament. The two original departments were later combined and moved to Sandhurst. In the United States, the United States Military Academy (USMA) in West Point, New York was founded on March 16, 1802, and is one of five service academies in the nation. == Types == === Pre-collegiate institutions === A military school teaches children of various ages (elementary school, middle school or high school) in a military environment which includes training in military aspects, such as drill. Many military schools are also boarding schools, and others are simply magnet schools in a larger school system. Many are privately run institutions, though some are public and are run either by a public school system (such as the Chicago Public Schools) or by a state. === Adult institutions === A college-level military academy is an institute of higher learning of things military. It is part of a larger system of military education and training institutions. The primary educational goal at military academies is to provide a high quality education that includes significant coursework and training in the fields of military tactics and military strategy. The amount of non-military coursework varies by both the institution and the country, and the amount of practical military experience gained varies as well. Military academies may or may not grant university degrees. In the US, graduates have a major field of study, earning a Bachelor's degree in that subject just as at other universities. However, in British academies, the graduate does not achieve a university degree, since the whole of the one-year course (undertaken mainly but not exclusively by university graduates) is dedicated to military training. There are two types of military academies: national (government-run) and state/private-run. Graduates from national academies are typically commissioned as officers in the country's military. The new officers usually have an obligation to serve for a certain number of years. In some countries (e.g. Britain) all military officers train at the appropriate academy, whereas in others (e.g. the United States) only a percentage do and the service academies are seen as institutions which supply service-specific officers within the forces (about 15 percent of US military officers). State or private-run academy graduates have no requirement to join the military after graduation, although some schools have a high rate of graduate military service. Today, most of these schools have ventured away from their military roots and now enroll both military and civilian students. The only exception in the United States is the Virginia Military Institute which remains all-military. == Albania == Armed Forces Academy == Angola == Army Military Academy National Air Force Academy

Sofia, founded with an Act of the 15th National Assembly of March 1, 1912, in Sofia == Canada == Two post-secondary military academies are operated under the Canadian Military Colleges system, the Royal Military College of Canada (RMCC) in Kingston, Ontario; and Royal Military College Saint-Jean (RMC Saint-Jean) in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. RMCC was established in 1876, while RMC Saint-Jean was established in 1954. The two institutions provided military education to officer cadets of all three elements in the Canadian Forces; the navy, army and air force; with RMC granted the authority to confer academic degrees in arts, science and engineering by the 1960s. From 1940 to 1995, the Department of National Defence operated a third military college in Victoria, British Columbia, known as Royal Roads Military College (RRMC). Graduates of the colleges are widely acknowledged to have had a disproportionate impact in the Canadian services and society, thanks to the solid foundations provided by their military education. Military discipline and training, as well as a focus on physical fitness and fluency in both of Canada's two official languages, English and French, provided cadets with ample challenges and a very fulfilling experience. In 1995 the Department of National Defence was forced to close RRMC and RMC Saint-Jean due to budget considerations, but RMCC continues to operate. (In the fall of 1995, the campus reopened as a civilian institution, Royal Roads University.) In 2007, the Department of National Defence reopened RMC Saint-Jean as a military academy that offers equivalent schooling as CEGEP, a level of post-secondary education in Quebec's education system. In 2021 RMC Saint-Jean was returned to university status and had officer cadets graduate and received their commission for the first time since 1995. In addition to Canadian Military Colleges, the Canadian Armed Forces also operate a number of training centres and schools, including the Canadian Forces College, and the Canadian Forces Language School. The components of the Canadian Armed Forces also maintain training centres and schools. The Canadian Army Doctrine and Training Centre (CADTC) is a formation in the Army that delivers combat, and doctrinal training. The CADTC includes several training establishments, such as the Canadian Manoeuvre Training Centre, Combat Training Centre, Command and Staff College, and the Peace Support Training Centre. The 2 Canadian Air Division is the formation responsible for training in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), and includes establishments like the Royal Canadian Air Force Academy, 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School, and 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School. The RCAF also maintains the Canadian Forces School of Survival and Aeromedical Training. In addition to publicly operated institutions, Canada is also home to one private military boarding school, Robert Land Academy, in West Lincoln, Ontario. Founded in 1978, it is an all-boys' institute that is fully accredited by Ontario's Ministry of Education. The school offers elementary and secondary levels of education, providing schooling for students from Grade 6 to Grade 12. == Colombia == National Army of Colombia: José María Córdova Military School, in Bogotá.

Its students also attend the civilian institut des hautes études de défense nationale. == Georgia == National Defense Academy Cadet Bachelor School Junior Officer Basic School Aviation Air Defense Officer Basic School Medical Officer School Captain Career School Command and General Staff School School of Advance Defense Studies Language Training School == Germany == The standard education in military leadership is the task of the Offizierschulen (officers' schools) run by the three branches. The contents differ from branch to branch. According to the doctrine \"leading by task\", in the army all prospective platoon leaders are trained down to the level of a commander of a mixed combat battalion. There they also have to pass an officer exam to become commissioned later on. Moreover, there exist so called Waffenschulen (schools of weapons) like infantry school or artillery school. There the officers learn to deal with the typical tasks of their respective corps. A specialty of the German concept of officer formation is the academic education. Germany runs two Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces where almost every future officer has to pass non-military studies and achieve a bachelor's or master's degree. During their studies (after at least three years of service) the candidates become commissioned Leutnant (second lieutenant). The three officer's schools are: The German Navy supervises: Naval Academy at Mürwik, in Flensburg-Mürwik The German Army supervises: Offizierschule des Heeres, in Dresden The German Air Force supervises: Offizierschule der Luftwaffe, in Fürstenfeldbruck Academic and staff education: Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces Helmut Schmidt University, in Hamburg Bundeswehr University Munich, in Munich Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr, in Hamburg == Greece == The Hellenic Armed Forces have military academies supervised by each branch of the Armed Forces individually: Highest Military Academies (ΑΣΣ) or Higher Military Educational Institutions (ΑΣΕΙ): The Hellenic Army supervises: The Evelpidon Military Academy, in Athens. The Corps Officers Military Academy, in Thessaloniki. The Nursery Officers Academy, in Athens. The Hellenic Air Force supervises: The Icarus Air Force Academy, in Tatoi (Athens). The Hellenic Navy supervises: The Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy, in Piraeus. Higher Military NCO Academies (ΑΣΣΥ): The Hellenic Army supervises the Military Non-commissioned Officers' Academy (ΣΜΥ). The Hellenic Air Force supervises the Air Force Non-commissioned Officers' Academy (ΣΜΥΑ). The Hellenic Navy supervises the Naval Non-commissioned Officers' Academy (ΣΜΥΝ). Despite their names (Greek: Σχολές Υπαξιωματικών, lit. 'Sub-officers' Academies'), their alumni can advance to the rank of Antisyntagmatarchis/Antipterachos/Antiploiarchos. == Hungary == National University of Public Service Faculty of Military Sciences and Officer Training == India == == Indonesia == The Indonesian Military Academy was founded in Yogyakarta, October 13, 1945, by the order of General Staff Chief of Indonesia Army Lieutenant General Urip Sumohardjo as the Militaire Academie (MA) Yogyakarta. Currently, the Tentara Nasional Indonesia or the TNI (Indonesian National Armed Forces), under the supervision of the Commanding General of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Academy System (a two or three-star officer in billet) in the HQ of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, has divided the academies into the three respective services: Indonesian Military Academy (Akademi Militer; Akmil), in Magelang, Central Java, is under the supervision of the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army, operated since 1946. Indonesian Naval Academy (Akademi Angkatan Laut; AAL), in Surabaya, East Java, is under the supervision of the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy. The Indonesian Naval Academy also educates and forms officers to serve in the Indonesian Marine Corps. In existence since 1951. Indonesian Air Force Academy (Akademi Angkatan Udara; AAU), in Yogyakarta, is under the supervision of the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Air Force. The academy has three majorings which are: electronics, engineering, and administration. Following graduation, students who are selected as Pilot and Navigator conduct further training in the Pilot and Navigator Flight School prior bearing the Pilot/Navigator designation. Active since 1945 (with its current form since 1965), but also inherits the traditions of former Dutch military aviation schools. Each service academy is headed by a two-star general who serves as superintendent, and his/her deputy is a one-star officer. All the students (cadets/midshipman) are recruited from senior high school graduates from all over Indonesia. Shortly after graduation, they are commissioned as Letnan Dua (Second Lieutenant/Ensign) in their respective service branches and receive a bachelor's degree comparable to those awarded by civil academies or universities. The length term is now 4 years and is divided into five grades of cadets' ranks, starting from the lowest: Prajurit Taruna (Cadet Private), 1st year (4 months) Kopral Taruna (Cadet Corporal), 1st year (8 months) Sersan Taruna (Cadet Sergeant), 2nd year Sersan Mayor Dua Taruna (Cadet Second Sergeant Major), 3rd year Sersan Mayor Satu Taruna (Cadet First Sergeant Major), 4th year Taruna is also a nickname to cadets in the Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies, however other nicknames such as Kadet refers to cadets in the Naval Academy, while Karbol refers to cadets in the Air Force Academy. The term \"Taruna\" however still applies to all cadets from the three academies. Until 1999, before the Indonesian National Police officially separated from the armed forces, the Indonesian Police Academy (\"AKPOL\") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia controlled by the National Police Headquarters (Mabes Polri), where in the other hand the Armed Forces (Army, Naval, and Air Force) Academies of Indonesia is under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense controlled by the Armed Forces General Headquarters (Mabes TNI). Presently, the Police Academy is in Semarang (Central Java), and is supervised under the supervision of the Chief of the Indonesian National Police (Kapolri). All three academies and the Police Academy have a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the cadets go to their respective academies to continue with the three remaining years of study before commissioning. == Iran == Iran has five main military universities: Imam Ali Officers' University (Persian: دانشگاه افسری امام علی; acronym: دا اف, DĀʿAF), formerly known as Officers' School (Persian: دانشکده افسری) is the military academy of Ground Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran Army, in Tehran, Iran.

These higher education institutions are operated by the Philippine Government and grant different baccalaureate degrees. Philippine Military Academy (Akademiyang Militar ng Pilipinas), City of Baguio – It is the primary training school of the Armed Forces of the Philippines for would be regular commissioned officers of the Philippine Army, Philippine Navy, Philippine Marine Corps and the Philippine Air Force. It is under the control of the Department of National Defense. Its former name was the Philippine Constabulary Academy. During the American colonial rule era, U.S. Army cavalry officers established the school for the professionalization of the enlisted personnel of the defunct Philippine Constabulary. It was renamed the Philippine Military Academy before the 1930s. In 1992, PMA stopped providing graduates to the Philippine Constabulary after the passage of Republic Act 6975 which resulted in the merger of the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police. The merged institutions was named the Philippine National Police. Beginning in 1993, PMA became a co-educational school. Philippine Merchant Marine Academy, Zambales – It is a school for students who shall serve in different private shipping companies, foreign or local. Its graduates may serve in the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy as an ensign after graduation depending upon their choice. All PMMA graduates are also automatically appointed by the president of the Philippines as ensigns (2nd lieutenants) in the Philippine Navy Reserve. This is the oldest of the Philippine service academies having been established in 1820 during the long period of Spanish colonial rule in the country, and was first situated in Manila for many years. Aside from the PMA and the PMMA, all three branches of the AFP have their own Officer Candidate Course Programs for both men and women, patterned after their US counterparts. The nation's higher military colleges are: Armed Forces of the Philippines Command and General Staff College, Quezon City – educates officers of the AFP not exceeding the ranks of Colonel or Navy Captain National Defense College of the Philippines, Quezon City – is a school for senior AFP officers for military/naval planning and to ready them in holding the ranks of Brigadier General/Commodore.

The purpose of such institutions is the military training of students and cadets under the reserve officer training program, and some of them conduct training, retraining and advanced training of military specialists of the appropriate levels of higher education (bachelor or master) for military service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, others formed in accordance with the laws Ukrainian military formations (Defence Forces of Ukraine), as well as law enforcement agencies for special purposes (Security Forces of Ukraine) and the State Transport Special Service of Ukraine. === Military colleges of non-commissioned officers (Military Sergeant Colleges of Ukraine) === NCO School of the Hetman Petro Sahaydachnyi National Ground Force Academy, Lviv NCO School of the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University, Kharkiv' Department of Military Training of the Professional College of Maritime Transport of the National University \"Odesa Maritime Academy\", Odesa Department of Training of Medical Assistants for the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the D.

There are also numerous Cadet forces that operate for all branches of the armed forces for children aged 10–20. These are not designed to recruit people into the armed forces but rather are simply Ministry of Defence sponsored youth organisations. === Undergraduate service === Although an undergraduate degree is not a prerequisite for officer training, the majority of potential officers will have attended university before joining the Armed Forces. At some universities there may be the option for people to join either a University Royal Naval Unit, a University Officer Training Corps (UOTC) or a University Air Squadron, which are designed to introduce students to life in the Forces and show them the careers that are available as well as allowing them to undertake reserve training alongside their degree. People sponsored under the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme will join one of the four Support Units attached to universities participating in DTUS. There is a requirement for bursars of DTUS to join the military for three years after completion of their degree, there no requirement for students of any other organisation to join the military after they finish their degree programs. Although service with these organisations may give some initial benefit to officer cadets attending the military colleges/academies, the next stage of the officer training programs assumes no prior military experience/knowledge, and those that did not partake in military activities at university are not disadvantaged. === Officer training === There are now four military academies in the United Kingdom. Although the curriculum at each varies due to the differing nature of the service a man or woman is joining, it is a combination of military and academic study that is designed to turn young civilians into comprehensively trained military officers. Britannia Royal Naval College, HMS Dartmouth Commando Training Centre Royal Marines Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Royal Air Force College Cranwell Officer Training for the Reserve Forces (e.g. Army Reserve, Royal Naval Reserve, RAF Reserves and Royal Marines Reserves) also takes place at the relevant military academies, but under a different curriculum and the courses tend to be concentrated into a much shorter period – a significant amount of the study will be undertaken at the officer cadet's reserve unit. === Postgraduate and staff training === Defence Academy of the United Kingdom Royal College of Defence Studies (mainly for officers of Colonel/Brigadier or equivalent rank selected as future senior leaders; highly selective) Joint Services Command and Staff College (courses for officers from Major to Brigadier or equivalent rank) Defence College of Management and Technology Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Advanced Research and Assessment Group Conflict Studies Research Centre == United States == === Introduction === In the United States, the term \"military academy\" does not necessarily mean a government-owned institution run by the armed forces to train its own officers. It may also mean a middle school, high school, or college, whether public or private, which instructs its students in military-style education, discipline and tradition. Students at such civilian institutions can earn a commission in the U.S. military through the successful completion of a Reserve Officer Training Corps program along with their college or university's academic coursework. The term military school primarily refers to pre-collegiate secondary-school-level military institutions. The term military academy commonly refers to a pre-collegiate, collegiate, and post-collegiate institution, especially the U.S. military-run academies. The term US military staff colleges refers to separate graduate schools catering to officers on active duty. Most state-level military academies maintain both a civilian student body and a traditional corps of cadets. The only exception is the Virginia Military Institute, which remains all-military. === Federal service academies === The colleges operated by the U.S. Federal Government, referred to as federal service academies, are: United States Military Academy, West Point, New York United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado United States Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York === Post-graduate school === Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland === Senior and junior military colleges === There is one all-military state-sponsored military academy: The Virginia Military Institute (VMI), Lexington, Virginia In addition, these five institutions that were military colleges at the time of their founding now maintain both a corps of cadets and a civilian student body. Many of these institutions also offer on-line degree programs: University of North Georgia, Dahlonega, Georgia — Formed by a 2013 merger with Gainesville State College, its main predecessor institution, last known as North Georgia College & State University, was chartered as a military college. However, when NGCSU was founded in 1873 as North Georgia Agricultural College, it had both a corps and a civilian student body, and was also the state's first coeducational college. Norwich University Corps of Cadets. Norwich University, Northfield, Vermont is a private university in Northfield, Vermont. It is the oldest private military college in the United States. The university was founded in 1819 at Norwich, Vermont, as the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. It is the oldest of six senior military colleges, and is recognized by the United States Department of Defense as the \"Birthplace of ROTC\" Texas A&M Corps of Cadets, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia Along with VMI, these institutions are known as the senior military colleges of the US. Today four institutions are considered military junior colleges (MJC). These four military schools participate in the Army's two-year Early Commissioning Program, an Army ROTC program where qualified students can earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant after only two years of college. The four military Junior colleges are as follows: Georgia Military College, Milledgeville, Georgia Marion Military Institute, Marion, Alabama New Mexico Military Institute, Roswell, New Mexico Valley Forge Military Academy and College, Wayne, Pennsylvania === Merchant Marine Academies that have military academy-style operations === There are six state-operated Merchant Marine academies: Massachusetts Maritime Academy Maine Maritime Academy State University of New York Maritime College (part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system) Texas A&M Maritime Academy (part of the Texas A&M University System) Great Lakes Maritime Academy (a division of Northwestern Michigan College) California State University Maritime Academy (part of the California State University system) These merchant marine academies operate on a military college system. Part of the training that the cadets receive is naval and military in nature. Cadets may apply for Naval Reserve commissions upon obtaining their Merchant Marine Officer's licenses. Most if not all also offer some form of military commissioning program into the active duty US Navy, US Marine Corps, or US Coast Guard. === Staff colleges === The United States staff colleges, mandated to serve the needs of officers for post-graduate studies and other such graduate institutions as mandated by the Department of Defense are: ==== United States Air Force Air University attached staff colleges ==== The Air University in Maxwell AFB, Alabama, includes: Squadron Officer College and Squadron Officer School Air Command and Staff College USAF Air War College ==== Staff colleges of the United States Army ==== United States Army Command and General Staff College United States Army School of Advanced Military Studies United States Army War College ==== Staff colleges of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps ==== Naval War College Naval Postgraduate School Marine Corps University Marine Corps War College ==== Joint Service staff colleges ==== National Defense University in Washington, D.C., includes: Joint Forces Staff College (Norfolk, Virginia) National War College Dwight D.

The Italian Military Academy was inaugurated in Turin on January 1, 1678, as the Savoy Royal Academy, making it the oldest military academy in existence. The Royal Danish Naval Academy was set up in 1701. The Royal Military Academy, Woolwich was set up in 1741, after a false start in 1720 because of a lack of funds, as the earliest military academy in Britain. Its original purpose was to train cadets entering the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. In France, the École Royale du Génie at Mézières was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the École Royale Militaire offering a general military education to the nobility.

By the turn of the century, under the impetus of the Napoleonic Wars and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions: to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission. The Kriegsakademie in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the École Royale Militaire of the Ancien Régime (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from).",

        "question": "How did the function of military academies evolve from their establishment in the 18th century to the period of the Napoleonic Wars?",
        "answer": "Initially, in the 18th century, military academies were founded to provide scientific training for officers in specialized technical corps like artillery and military engineering. Following the Napoleonic Wars, their role expanded to serve two primary functions: instructing serving officers for staff-officer duties and educating young men before they received an officer's commission.",

        "answer": "Adult military academies are institutions of higher learning focused on military tactics and strategy. In the US, graduates from academies like the USMA earn a Bachelor's degree. In British academies, the course is dedicated to military training and does not grant a university degree. In contrast, pre-collegiate military schools are for elementary, middle, or high school children and teach in a military environment, including aspects like drill, rather than providing higher education or university degrees.",

        "question": "What impact did the Napoleonic Wars have on the establishment of military academies, and which specific academies were founded in Europe and the United States around the turn of the 19th century?",
        "answer": "The Napoleonic Wars created a strain on European armies, which served as an impetus for establishing military academies in most combatant nations. These schools had two functions: to instruct serving officers in staff duties and to school young men before they received an officer's commission. Academies founded during this period include the Kriegsakademie in Prussia (1801), the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France (1802), the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in England (1801), and the United States Military Academy at West Point (1802).",

        "answer": "In the United States, graduates from military academies earn a Bachelor's degree, and these national academies supply approximately 15% of the country's military officers. In contrast, British academies do not grant university degrees because their one-year course is dedicated entirely to military training, and all of Britain's military officers train at the appropriate academy.",

        "answer": "The Royal Military College Saint-Jean (RMC Saint-Jean) was established in 1954 in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. In 1995, the Department of National Defence closed the college due to budget considerations. It was later reopened in 2007 as a military academy offering schooling equivalent to CEGEP, a level of post-secondary education in Quebec. In 2021, RMC Saint-Jean was returned to university status and began graduating officer cadets with commissions for the first time since its closure in 1995.",
