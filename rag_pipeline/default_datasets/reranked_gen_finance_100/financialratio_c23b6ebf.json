Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies. If shares in a company are publicly listed, the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios. Ratios can be expressed as a decimal value, such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent percentage value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%. == Sources of data == Values used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of changes in equity. These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or financial statements. The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation. == Purpose and types == Financial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the financial statement analysis. Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures. Profitability ratios measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return. Liquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt. Efficiency (activity) ratios measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets. Debt ratios measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt. Market ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock. These are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares. Financial ratios allow for comparisons between companies between industries between different time periods for one company between a single company and its industry average Ratios generally are not useful unless they are benchmarked against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare. == Accounting methods and principles == Financial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different accounting methods or follow various standard accounting practices. Most public companies are required by law to use generally accepted accounting principles for their home countries, but private companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships may elect to not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use International Financial Reporting Standards to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country. There is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods. == Types of Ratio Comparisons == An important feature of ratio analysis is interpreting ratio values. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed to answer questions such as \"Is it too high or too low?\" or \"Is it good or bad?\". Two types of ratio comparisons can be made, cross-sectional and time-series. === Cross-Sectional Analysis === Cross-sectional analysis compares the financial ratios of different companies at the same point in time. It allows companies to benchmark from other competitors by comparing their ratio values to similar companies in the industry. === Time-Series Analysis === Time-series analysis evaluates a company's performance over time. It compares its current performance against past or historical performance. This can help assess the company's progress by looking into developing trends or year-to-year changes. == Abbreviations and terminology == Various abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the Internet. Sales reported by a firm are usually net sales, which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an invoice. Net income is always the amount after taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below). Companies that are primarily involved in providing services with labour do not generally report \"Sales\" based on hours. These companies tend to report \"revenue\" based on the monetary value of income that the services provide. Note that Shareholders' Equity and Owner's Equity are not the same thing, Shareholder's Equity represents the total number of shares in the company multiplied by each share's book value; Owner's Equity represents the total number of shares that an individual shareholder owns (usually the owner with controlling interest), multiplied by each share's book value. It is important to make this distinction when calculating ratios. === Abbreviations === (Note: These are not ratios, but values in currency.) COGS = Cost of goods sold, or cost of sales. EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxes EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EPS = Earnings per share == Ratios == === Profitability ratios === Profitability ratios measure the company's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return. === Liquidity ratios === Liquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt. === Efficiency ratios === Efficiency ratios measure the effectiveness of the firm's use of resources. === Debt ratios === Debt ratios quantify the firm's ability to repay long-term debt. Debt ratios measure the level of borrowed funds used by the firm to finance its activities. === Market ratios === Market ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock. These are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares. === Other ratios === === Capital budgeting ratios === In addition to assisting management and owners in diagnosing the financial health of their company, ratios can also help managers make decisions about investments or projects that the company is considering to take, such as acquisitions, or expansion. Many formal methods are used in capital budgeting, including the techniques such as Net present value Profitability index Internal rate of return Modified internal rate of return Equivalent annuity == See also == List of financial performance measures == References == == External links == Stock Valuation Metrics"

        "question": "How are specific metrics like profitability or debt ratios made useful for analysis, and what is a key challenge when comparing these ratios between companies in different industries?",
        "answer": "Financial ratios, which measure aspects like a firm's profitability or its ability to repay long-term debt, are made useful by benchmarking them against something else, such as the company's past performance, another company, or an industry average. A key challenge when comparing these ratios is that firms in different industries are difficult to compare because they face different risks, capital requirements, and levels of competition.",

        "question": "What are some key terminological distinctions to be aware of when analyzing a company's financial statements?",
        "answer": "When analyzing financial statements, it is important to understand several distinctions. For income, sales are usually reported as net sales (deducting returns and discounts), and net income is the amount after taxes and other expenses, unlike EBIT or EBITDA. Service-based companies may report \"revenue\" instead of \"sales.\" For equity, it is crucial to distinguish between Shareholders' Equity, which is the book value of all shares in the company, and Owner's Equity, which is the book value of shares held by a specific individual shareholder.",
