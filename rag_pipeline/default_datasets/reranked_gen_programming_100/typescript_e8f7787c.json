It is designed for developing large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. It is developed by Microsoft as free and open-source software released under an Apache License 2.0. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with React.js, Node.js, Deno or Bun). Multiple options are available for transpiling. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript. TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js library modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript. The TypeScript compiler is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on developing TypeScript. == History == TypeScript was released to the public in October 2012, with version 0.8, after two years of internal development at Microsoft. Soon after the initial public release, Miguel de Icaza praised the language, but criticized the lack of mature integrated development environment (IDE) support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was unavailable then on Linux and macOS. As of April 2021 there is support in other IDEs and text editors, including Emacs, Vim, WebStorm, Atom and Microsoft's own Visual Studio Code. TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics. TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014. Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provided built-in support for TypeScript. Further improvement were made in July 2014, when the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, asserted to have a five-fold performance increase. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub. On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released, introducing several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally enforce null safety, to mitigate what's sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake. TypeScript 3.0 was released on 30 July 2018, bringing many language additions like tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions, rest parameters with tuple types, generic rest parameters and so on. TypeScript 4.0 was released on 20 August 2020. While 4.0 did not introduce any breaking changes, it added language features such as Custom JSX Factories and Variadic Tuple Types. TypeScript 5.0 was released on 16 March 2023 and included support for decorators. On March 11, 2025 Anders Hejlsberg announced on the TypeScript blog that the team is working on a Go port of the TypeScript compiler to be released as TypeScript version 7.0 later this year. It is expected to feature a 10x speedup. == Design == TypeScript originated from the shortcomings of JavaScript for developing large-scale applications both at Microsoft and among their external customers. Challenges with dealing with complex JavaScript code led to demand for custom tooling to ease developing of components in the language. Developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the ECMAScript (ES) standard and its ecosystem, so a compiler was developed to transform a superset of JavaScript with type annotations and classes (TypeScript files) back into vanilla ECMAScript 5 code. TypeScript classes were based on the then-proposed ECMAScript 6 class specification to make writing prototypal inheritance less verbose and error-prone, and type annotations enabled IntelliSense and improved tooling. == Features == TypeScript adds the following syntax extensions to JavaScript: Type signatures (annotations) and compile-time type checking Type inference Interfaces Enumerated types Generics Namespaces Tuples Explicit resource management Syntactically, TypeScript is very similar to JScript .NET, another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA-262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object-oriented language features such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces. Other inspirations include Java and C#. === Type annotations === TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time. Primitive types are annotated using all-lowercase types, such as number, boolean, bigint, and string. These types are distinct from their boxed counterparts (Number, Boolean, etc), which cannot have operations performed from values directly (a Number and number cannot be added). There are additionally undefined and null types for their respective values. All other non-primitive types are annotated using their class name, such as Error. Arrays can be written in two different ways which are both syntactically the same: the generic-based syntax Array and a shorthand with T[]. Additional built-in data types are tuples, unions, never, unknown, void, and any: An array with predefined data types at each index is a tuple, represented as [type1, type2, ..., typeN]. A variable that can hold more than one type of data is a union, represented using the logical OR | symbol (string | number). The never type is used when a given type should be impossible to create, which is useful for filtering mapped types. The unknown type is used when dealing with data of an unpredictable shape. Unlike any, an unknown-typed variable will throw compilation errors when attempting to access properties or methods on that variable without first narrowing the type to something known. This type is often used for catching Errors, handling API responses, or user input. The void type is used to represent the lack of a type, e.g. from a function with no return statement. A value of type any supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed, which makes it suitable for weakly or dynamically-typed structures. This is generally discouraged practice and should be avoided when possible. Type annotations can be exported to a separate declarations file to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for Node.js and jQuery. The TypeScript compiler makes use of type inference when types are not given. For example, the add method in the code above would be inferred as returning a number even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of left and right being numbers, and the compiler's knowledge that the result of adding two numbers is always a number. If no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations (such as in a JavaScript module without types), then it defaults to the dynamic any type. Additional module types can be provided using a .d.ts declaration file using the declare module \"moduleName\" syntax. === Declaration files === When a TypeScript script gets compiled, there is an option to generate a declaration file (with the extension .d.ts) that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. In the process, the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript. The concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of header files found in C/C++. Type declaration files can be written by hand for existing JavaScript libraries, as has been done for jQuery and Node.js. Large collections of declaration files for popular JavaScript libraries are hosted on GitHub in DefinitelyTyped. === Generics === TypeScript supports generic programming using a syntax similar to Java. The following is an example of the identity function. === Classes === TypeScript uses the same annotation style for class methods and fields as for functions and variables respectively. Compared with vanilla JavaScript classes, a TypeScript class can also implement an interface through the implements keyword, use generic parameters similarly to Java, and specify public and private fields. === Union types === === Enumerated types === === Modules and namespaces === TypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) use JavaScript immediately-invoked function expressions to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) use existing JavaScript library patterns (CommonJS or ES Modules). == Compatibility with JavaScript == As TypeScript is simply a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript can be quickly adapted to TypeScript and TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. The compiler can target all ECMAScript versions 5 and above, transpiling modern features like classes and arrow functions to their older counterparts. With TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript. Type declarations for these libraries are usually provided with the source code but can be declared or installed separately if needed. == Development tools == === Compiler === The TypeScript compiler, named tsc, is written in TypeScript. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a Node.js package that uses Node.js as a host. The compiler can target a given edition of ECMAScript (such as ECMAScript 5 for legacy browser compatibility), but by default compiles for the latest standards. === IDE and editor support === Microsoft provides a plug-in for Visual Studio 2012 and WebMatrix, full integrated support in Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2015, and basic text editor support for Emacs and Vim. Visual Studio Code supports TypeScript in addition to several other languages, and offers features like debugging and intelligent code completion. alm.tools is an open source cloud IDE for TypeScript built using TypeScript, ReactJS and TypeStyle. JetBrains supports TypeScript with code completion, refactoring and debugging in its IDEs built on IntelliJ platform, such as PhpStorm 6, WebStorm 6, and IntelliJ IDEA, as well as their Visual Studio Add-in and extension, ReSharper 8.1. Atom has a TypeScript plugin with support for code completion, navigation, formatting, and fast compilation. The online Cloud9 IDE and Codenvy support TypeScript. A plugin is available for the NetBeans IDE. A plugin is available for the Eclipse IDE (version Kepler) TypEcs is available for the Eclipse IDE. The Cross Platform Cloud IDE Codeanywhere supports TypeScript. Webclipse An Eclipse plugin designed to develop TypeScript and Angular 2. Angular IDE A standalone IDE available via npm to develop TypeScript and Angular 2 applications, with integrated terminal support. Tide – TypeScript Interactive Development Environment for Emacs. === Integration with build automation tools === Using plug-ins, TypeScript can be integrated with build automation tools, including Grunt (grunt-ts), Apache Maven (TypeScript Maven Plugin), Gulp (gulp-typescript) and Gradle (TypeScript Gradle Plugin). === Linting tools === TSLint scans TypeScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. ESLint, a standard JavaScript linter, also provided some support for TypeScript via community plugins. However, ESLint's inability to leverage TypeScript's language services precluded certain forms of semantic linting and program-wide analysis. In early 2019, the TSLint team announced the linter's deprecation in favor of typescript-eslint, a joint effort of the TSLint, ESLint and TypeScript teams to consolidate linting under the ESLint umbrella for improved performance, community unity and developer accessibility. == Release history == == See also == Dart Kotlin JS++ PureScript == References == === Citations === === Sources === == External links == Official website TypeScript on GitHub"

        "question": "Trace the evolution of TypeScript's features, from its initial design principles to the additions in major version releases, in its goal to improve large-scale JavaScript development.",
        "answer": "TypeScript was designed to address JavaScript's shortcomings in large-scale applications by creating a superset that compiles to standard ECMAScript. The initial design focused on adding type annotations and classes to improve tooling and make inheritance less verbose. This was implemented through core features like type signatures, compile-time type checking, interfaces, and tuples. Later versions built upon this foundation: version 2.0 added optional null safety, versions 3.0 and 4.0 introduced advanced tuple features like variadic tuple types, and version 5.0 added support for decorators, all aimed at enhancing the language for complex projects.",

      {
        "question": "How does TypeScript handle situations where a type is not explicitly annotated, and what is the role of the `any` type in this process?",
        "answer": "When a type is not explicitly given, the TypeScript compiler uses type inference to deduce the type based on context. For instance, it can infer that a function adding two variables of type `number` will return a `number`. If the compiler is unable to infer a type, such as in a JavaScript module without type declarations, it will default to the `any` type. A value of type `any` has minimal static type checking and supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript, though its use is generally discouraged.",

        "question": "How does TypeScript integrate with existing JavaScript libraries like Node.js or jQuery?",
        "answer": "TypeScript integrates with existing JavaScript libraries through definition files, which function similarly to C++ header files. These files provide type information for the libraries, allowing programs to use their values as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. Third-party header files are available for popular libraries like jQuery, MongoDB, D3.js, and for Node.js modules, which facilitates the development of programs for these platforms within TypeScript.",

        "answer": "The `any` type is a dynamic type that supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript with minimal static type checking. It is applied in two main circumstances: first, it can be explicitly used for weakly or dynamically-typed structures, although this practice is generally discouraged. Second, the compiler implicitly defaults to the `any` type when it cannot infer a variable's type due to a lack of declarations.",
