Surrogacy: the law and process of giving birth as a surrogate mother Child protective proceedings: court proceedings that may result from state intervention in cases of child abuse and child neglect Juvenile law: Matters relating to minors including status offenses, delinquency, emancipation and juvenile adjudication Paternity: proceedings to establish and disestablish paternity, and the administration of paternity testing Rights: Children's rights, Youth rights, Mothers' rights, Fathers' rights, Parents' rights, Right to family life This list is not exhaustive and varies depending on jurisdiction. == Conflict of laws == Issues may arise in family law where there is a question as to the laws of the jurisdiction that apply to the marriage relationship or to custody and divorce, and whether a divorce or child custody order is recognized under the laws of another jurisdiction. For child custody, many nations have joined the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction in order to grant recognition to other member states' custody orders and avoid issues of parental kidnapping. == By jurisdiction == == See also == == References == == Further reading == David Bradley. ‘Family law’, in Elgar encyclopedia of comparative law, 3rd edn.
