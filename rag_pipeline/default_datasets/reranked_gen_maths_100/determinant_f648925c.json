The determinant of a matrix A is commonly denoted det(A), det A, or |A|. Its value characterizes some properties of the matrix and the linear map represented, on a given basis, by the matrix. In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible and the corresponding linear map is an isomorphism. However, if the determinant is zero, the matrix is referred to as singular, meaning it does not have an inverse. The determinant is completely determined by the two following properties: the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, and the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. The determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix is | a b c d | = a d − b c , {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{vmatrix}}=ad-bc,} and the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix is | a b c d e f g h i | = a e i + b f g + c d h − c e g − b d i − a f h . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{vmatrix}}=aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.} The determinant of an n × n matrix can be defined in several equivalent ways, the most common being Leibniz formula, which expresses the determinant as a sum of n ! {\\displaystyle n!} (the factorial of n) signed products of matrix entries. It can be computed by the Laplace expansion, which expresses the determinant as a linear combination of determinants of submatrices, or with Gaussian elimination, which allows computing a row echelon form with the same determinant, equal to the product of the diagonal entries of the row echelon form. Determinants can also be defined by some of their properties. Namely, the determinant is the unique function defined on the n × n matrices that has the four following properties: The determinant of the identity matrix is 1. The exchange of two rows multiplies the determinant by −1. Multiplying a row by a number multiplies the determinant by this number. Adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant. The above properties relating to rows (properties 2–4) may be replaced by the corresponding statements with respect to columns. The determinant is invariant under matrix similarity. This implies that, given a linear endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space, the determinant of the matrix that represents it on a basis does not depend on the chosen basis. This allows defining the determinant of a linear endomorphism, which does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system. Determinants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the coefficients in a system of linear equations, and determinants can be used to solve these equations (Cramer's rule), although other methods of solution are computationally much more efficient. Determinants are used for defining the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In geometry, the signed n-dimensional volume of a n-dimensional parallelepiped is expressed by a determinant, and the determinant of a linear endomorphism determines how the orientation and the n-dimensional volume are transformed under the endomorphism. This is used in calculus with exterior differential forms and the Jacobian determinant, in particular for changes of variables in multiple integrals. == Two by two matrices == The determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix ( a b c d ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{pmatrix}}} is denoted either by \"det\" or by vertical bars around the matrix, and is defined as det ( a b c d ) = | a b c d | = a d − b c . {\\displaystyle \\det {\\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{pmatrix}}={\\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{vmatrix}}=ad-bc.} For example, det ( 3 7 1 − 4 ) = | 3 7 1 − 4 | = ( 3 ⋅ ( − 4 ) ) − ( 7 ⋅ 1 ) = − 19. {\\displaystyle \\det {\\begin{pmatrix}3&7\\\\1&-4\\end{pmatrix}}={\\begin{vmatrix}3&7\\\\1&{-4}\\end{vmatrix}}=(3\\cdot (-4))-(7\\cdot 1)=-19.} === First properties === The determinant has several key properties that can be proved by direct evaluation of the definition for 2 × 2 {\\displaystyle 2\\times 2} -matrices, and that continue to hold for determinants of larger matrices. They are as follows: first, the determinant of the identity matrix ( 1 0 0 1 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}}} is 1. Second, the determinant is zero if two rows are the same: | a b a b | = a b − b a = 0. {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\\\a&b\\end{vmatrix}}=ab-ba=0.} This holds similarly if the two columns are the same. Moreover, | a b + b ′ c d + d ′ | = a ( d + d ′ ) − ( b + b ′ ) c = | a b c d | + | a b ′ c d ′ | . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}a&b+b'\\\\c&d+d'\\end{vmatrix}}=a(d+d')-(b+b')c={\\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{vmatrix}}+{\\begin{vmatrix}a&b'\\\\c&d'\\end{vmatrix}}.} Finally, if any column is multiplied by some number r {\\displaystyle r} (i.e., all entries in that column are multiplied by that number), the determinant is also multiplied by that number: | r ⋅ a b r ⋅ c d | = r a d − b r c = r ( a d − b c ) = r ⋅ | a b c d | . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}r\\cdot a&b\\\\r\\cdot c&d\\end{vmatrix}}=rad-brc=r(ad-bc)=r\\cdot {\\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{vmatrix}}.} == Geometric meaning == If the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix A represents the linear map that maps the basis vectors to the columns of A. The images of the basis vectors form a parallelogram that represents the image of the unit square under the mapping. The parallelogram defined by the columns of the above matrix is the one with vertices at (0, 0), (a, c), (a + b, c + d), and (b, d), as shown in the accompanying diagram. The absolute value of ad − bc is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by A. The absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the signed area of the parallelogram. The signed area is the same as the usual area, except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the identity matrix). To show that ad − bc is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors u ≡ (a, c) and v ≡ (b, d) representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as |u| |v| sin θ for the angle θ between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the sine this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. u⊥ = (−c, a), so that |u⊥| |v| cos θ′ becomes the signed area in question, which can be determined by the pattern of the scalar product to be equal to ad − bc according to the following equations: Signed area = | u | | v | sin θ = | u ⊥ | | v | cos θ ′ = ( − c a ) ⋅ ( b d ) = a d − b c . {\\displaystyle {\\text{Signed area}}=|{\\boldsymbol {u}}|\\,|{\\boldsymbol {v}}|\\,\\sin \\,\\theta =\\left|{\\boldsymbol {u}}^{\\perp }\\right|\\,\\left|{\\boldsymbol {v}}\\right|\\,\\cos \\,\\theta '={\\begin{pmatrix}-c\\\\a\\end{pmatrix}}\\cdot {\\begin{pmatrix}b\\\\d\\end{pmatrix}}=ad-bc.} Thus the determinant gives the area scale factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by A. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix preserves area and orientation. If an n × n real matrix A is written in terms of its column vectors A = [ a 1 a 2 ⋯ a n ] {\\displaystyle A=\\left[{\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}\\mathbf {a} _{1}&\\mathbf {a} _{2}&\\cdots &\\mathbf {a} _{n}\\end{array}}\\right]} , then A ( 1 0 ⋮ 0 ) = a 1 , A ( 0 1 ⋮ 0 ) = a 2 , … , A ( 0 0 ⋮ 1 ) = a n . {\\displaystyle A{\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\\\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix}}=\\mathbf {a} _{1},\\quad A{\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\\\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix}}=\\mathbf {a} _{2},\\quad \\ldots ,\\quad A{\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\\\vdots \\\\1\\end{pmatrix}}=\\mathbf {a} _{n}.} This means that A {\\displaystyle A} maps the unit n-cube to the n-dimensional parallelotope defined by the vectors a 1 , a 2 , … , a n , {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {a} _{1},\\mathbf {a} _{2},\\ldots ,\\mathbf {a} _{n},} the region P = { c 1 a 1 + ⋯ + c n a n ∣ 0 ≤ c i ≤ 1 ∀ i } {\\displaystyle P=\\left\\{c_{1}\\mathbf {a} _{1}+\\cdots +c_{n}\\mathbf {a} _{n}\\mid 0\\leq c_{i}\\leq 1\\ \\forall i\\right\\}} ( ∀ {\\textstyle \\forall } stands for \"for all\" as a logical symbol.) The determinant gives the signed n-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, det ( A ) = ± vol ( P ) , {\\displaystyle \\det(A)=\\pm {\\text{vol}}(P),} and hence describes more generally the n-dimensional volume scale factor of the linear transformation produced by A. (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses orientation.) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully n-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of A is less than n. This means that A produces a linear transformation which is neither onto nor one-to-one, and so is not invertible. == Definition == Let A be a square matrix with n rows and n columns, so that it can be written as A = [ a 1 , 1 a 1 , 2 ⋯ a 1 , n a 2 , 1 a 2 , 2 ⋯ a 2 , n ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ a n , 1 a n , 2 ⋯ a n , n ] . {\\displaystyle A={\\begin{bmatrix}a_{1,1}&a_{1,2}&\\cdots &a_{1,n}\\\\a_{2,1}&a_{2,2}&\\cdots &a_{2,n}\\\\\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\a_{n,1}&a_{n,2}&\\cdots &a_{n,n}\\end{bmatrix}}.} The entries a 1 , 1 {\\displaystyle a_{1,1}} etc. are, for many purposes, real or complex numbers. As discussed below, the determinant is also defined for matrices whose entries are in a commutative ring. The determinant of A is denoted by det(A), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets: | a 1 , 1 a 1 , 2 ⋯ a 1 , n a 2 , 1 a 2 , 2 ⋯ a 2 , n ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ a n , 1 a n , 2 ⋯ a n , n | . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}a_{1,1}&a_{1,2}&\\cdots &a_{1,n}\\\\a_{2,1}&a_{2,2}&\\cdots &a_{2,n}\\\\\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\a_{n,1}&a_{n,2}&\\cdots &a_{n,n}\\end{vmatrix}}.} There are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a square matrix A, i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns: the determinant can be defined via the Leibniz formula, an explicit formula involving sums of products of certain entries of the matrix. The determinant can also be characterized as the unique function depending on the entries of the matrix satisfying certain properties. This approach can also be used to compute determinants by simplifying the matrices in question. === Leibniz formula === ==== 3 × 3 matrices ==== The Leibniz formula for the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix is the following: | a b c d e f g h i | = a e i + b f g + c d h − c e g − b d i − a f h . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{vmatrix}}=aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.\\ } In this expression, each term has one factor from each row, all in different columns, arranged in increasing row order. For example, bdi has b from the first row second column, d from the second row first column, and i from the third row third column. The signs are determined by how many transpositions of factors are necessary to arrange the factors in increasing order of their columns (given that the terms are arranged left-to-right in increasing row order): positive for an even number of transpositions and negative for an odd number. For the example of bdi, the single transposition of bd to db gives dbi, whose three factors are from the first, second and third columns respectively; this is an odd number of transpositions, so the term appears with negative sign. The rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic for the expanded form of this determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration. This scheme for calculating the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix does not carry over into higher dimensions. ==== n × n matrices ==== Generalizing the above to higher dimensions, the determinant of an n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrix is an expression involving permutations and their signatures. A permutation of the set { 1 , 2 , … , n } {\\displaystyle \\{1,2,\\dots ,n\\}} is a bijective function σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } from this set to itself, with values σ ( 1 ) , σ ( 2 ) , … , σ ( n ) {\\displaystyle \\sigma (1),\\sigma (2),\\ldots ,\\sigma (n)} exhausting the entire set. The set of all such permutations, called the symmetric group, is commonly denoted S n {\\displaystyle S_{n}} . The signature sgn ⁡ ( σ ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {sgn}(\\sigma )} of a permutation σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } is + 1 , {\\displaystyle +1,} if the permutation can be obtained with an even number of transpositions (exchanges of two entries); otherwise, it is − 1. {\\displaystyle -1.} Given a matrix A = [ a 1 , 1 … a 1 , n ⋮ ⋮ a n , 1 … a n , n ] , {\\displaystyle A={\\begin{bmatrix}a_{1,1}\\ldots a_{1,n}\\\\\\vdots \\qquad \\vdots \\\\a_{n,1}\\ldots a_{n,n}\\end{bmatrix}},} the Leibniz formula for its determinant is, using sigma notation for the sum, det ( A ) = | a 1 , 1 … a 1 , n ⋮ ⋮ a n , 1 … a n , n | = ∑ σ ∈ S n sgn ⁡ ( σ ) a 1 , σ ( 1 ) ⋯ a n , σ ( n ) . {\\displaystyle \\det(A)={\\begin{vmatrix}a_{1,1}\\ldots a_{1,n}\\\\\\vdots \\qquad \\vdots \\\\a_{n,1}\\ldots a_{n,n}\\end{vmatrix}}=\\sum _{\\sigma \\in S_{n}}\\operatorname {sgn}(\\sigma )a_{1,\\sigma (1)}\\cdots a_{n,\\sigma (n)}.} Using pi notation for the product, this can be shortened into det ( A ) = ∑ σ ∈ S n ( sgn ⁡ ( σ ) ∏ i = 1 n a i , σ ( i ) ) {\\displaystyle \\det(A)=\\sum _{\\sigma \\in S_{n}}\\left(\\operatorname {sgn}(\\sigma )\\prod _{i=1}^{n}a_{i,\\sigma (i)}\\right)} . The Levi-Civita symbol ε i 1 , … , i n {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon _{i_{1},\\ldots ,i_{n}}} is defined on the n-tuples of integers in { 1 , … , n } {\\displaystyle \\{1,\\ldots ,n\\}} as 0 if two of the integers are equal, and otherwise as the signature of the permutation defined by the n-tuple of integers. With the Levi-Civita symbol, the Leibniz formula becomes det ( A ) = ∑ i 1 , i 2 , … , i n ε i 1 ⋯ i n a 1 , i 1 ⋯ a n , i n , {\\displaystyle \\det(A)=\\sum _{i_{1},i_{2},\\ldots ,i_{n}}\\varepsilon _{i_{1}\\cdots i_{n}}a_{1,i_{1}}\\!\\cdots a_{n,i_{n}},} where the sum is taken over all n-tuples of integers in { 1 , … , n } . {\\displaystyle \\{1,\\ldots ,n\\}.} == Properties == === Characterization of the determinant === The determinant can be characterized by the following three key properties. To state these, it is convenient to regard an n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrix A as being composed of its n {\\displaystyle n} columns, so denoted as A = ( a 1 , … , a n ) , {\\displaystyle A={\\big (}a_{1},\\dots ,a_{n}{\\big )},} where the column vector a i {\\displaystyle a_{i}} (for each i) is composed of the entries of the matrix in the i-th column. det ( I ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\det \\left(I\\right)=1} , where I {\\displaystyle I} is an identity matrix. The determinant is multilinear: if the jth column of a matrix A {\\displaystyle A} is written as a linear combination a j = r ⋅ v + w {\\displaystyle a_{j}=r\\cdot v+w} of two column vectors v and w and a number r, then the determinant of A is expressible as a similar linear combination: | A | = | a 1 , … , a j − 1 , r ⋅ v + w , a j + 1 , … , a n | = r ⋅ | a 1 , … , v , … a n | + | a 1 , … , w , … , a n | {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}|A|&={\\big |}a_{1},\\dots ,a_{j-1},r\\cdot v+w,a_{j+1},\\dots ,a_{n}|\\\\&=r\\cdot |a_{1},\\dots ,v,\\dots a_{n}|+|a_{1},\\dots ,w,\\dots ,a_{n}|\\end{aligned}}} The determinant is alternating: whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0: | a 1 , … , v , … , v , … , a n | = 0. {\\displaystyle |a_{1},\\dots ,v,\\dots ,v,\\dots ,a_{n}|=0.} If the determinant is defined using the Leibniz formula as above, these three properties can be proved by direct inspection of that formula. Some authors also approach the determinant directly using these three properties: it can be shown that there is exactly one function that assigns to any n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrix A a number that satisfies these three properties. This also shows that this more abstract approach to the determinant yields the same definition as the one using the Leibniz formula. To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a standard basis vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property 9) or else ±1 (by properties 1 and 12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. === Immediate consequences === These rules have several further consequences: The determinant is a homogeneous function, i.e., det ( c A ) = c n det ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\det(cA)=c^{n}\\det(A)} (for an n × n {\\displaystyle n\\times n} matrix A {\\displaystyle A} ). Interchanging any pair of columns of a matrix multiplies its determinant by −1. This follows from the determinant being multilinear and alternating (properties 2 and 3 above): | a 1 , … , a j , … a i , … , a n | = − | a 1 , … , a i , … , a j , … , a n | . {\\displaystyle |a_{1},\\dots ,a_{j},\\dots a_{i},\\dots ,a_{n}|=-|a_{1},\\dots ,a_{i},\\dots ,a_{j},\\dots ,a_{n}|.} This formula can be applied iteratively when several columns are swapped. For example | a 3 , a 1 , a 2 , a 4 … , a n | = − | a 1 , a 3 , a 2 , a 4 , … , a n | = | a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , … , a n | . {\\displaystyle |a_{3},a_{1},a_{2},a_{4}\\dots ,a_{n}|=-|a_{1},a_{3},a_{2},a_{4},\\dots ,a_{n}|=|a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},\\dots ,a_{n}|.} Yet more generally, any permutation of the columns multiplies the determinant by the sign of the permutation. If some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a linearly dependent set), the determinant is 0. As a special case, this includes: if some column is such that all its entries are zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0. Adding a scalar multiple of one column to another column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of multilinearity and being alternative: by multilinearity the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0, since the determinant is alternating. If A {\\displaystyle A} is a triangular matrix, i.e. a i j = 0 {\\displaystyle a_{ij}=0} , whenever i > j {\\displaystyle i>j} or, alternatively, whenever i < j {\\displaystyle i n are zero and the remaining polynomial is det(I + sA). === Upper and lower bounds === For a positive definite matrix A, the trace operator gives the following tight lower and upper bounds on the log determinant tr ⁡ ( I − A − 1 ) ≤ log ⁡ det ( A ) ≤ tr ⁡ ( A − I ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {tr} \\left(I-A^{-1}\\right)\\leq \\log \\det(A)\\leq \\operatorname {tr} (A-I)} with equality if and only if A = I. This relationship can be derived via the formula for the Kullback–Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions. Also, n tr ⁡ ( A − 1 ) ≤ det ( A ) 1 n ≤ 1 n tr ⁡ ( A ) ≤ 1 n tr ⁡ ( A 2 ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {n}{\\operatorname {tr} \\left(A^{-1}\\right)}}\\leq \\det(A)^{\\frac {1}{n}}\\leq {\\frac {1}{n}}\\operatorname {tr} (A)\\leq {\\sqrt {{\\frac {1}{n}}\\operatorname {tr} \\left(A^{2}\\right)}}.} These inequalities can be proved by expressing the traces and the determinant in terms of the eigenvalues. As such, they represent the well-known fact that the harmonic mean is less than the geometric mean, which is less than the arithmetic mean, which is, in turn, less than the root mean square. === Derivative === The Leibniz formula shows that the determinant of real (or analogously for complex) square matrices is a polynomial function from R n × n {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} ^{n\\times n}} to R {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} } . In particular, it is everywhere differentiable. Its derivative can be expressed using Jacobi's formula: d det ( A ) d α = tr ⁡ ( adj ⁡ ( A ) d A d α ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d\\det(A)}{d\\alpha }}=\\operatorname {tr} \\left(\\operatorname {adj} (A){\\frac {dA}{d\\alpha }}\\right).} where adj ⁡ ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {adj} (A)} denotes the adjugate of A {\\displaystyle A} . In particular, if A {\\displaystyle A} is invertible, we have d det ( A ) d α = det ( A ) tr ⁡ ( A − 1 d A d α ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d\\det(A)}{d\\alpha }}=\\det(A)\\operatorname {tr} \\left(A^{-1}{\\frac {dA}{d\\alpha }}\\right).} Expressed in terms of the entries of A {\\displaystyle A} , these are ∂ det ( A ) ∂ A i j = adj ⁡ ( A ) j i = det ( A ) ( A − 1 ) j i . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial \\det(A)}{\\partial A_{ij}}}=\\operatorname {adj} (A)_{ji}=\\det(A)\\left(A^{-1}\\right)_{ji}.} Yet another equivalent formulation is det ( A + ϵ X ) − det ( A ) = tr ⁡ ( adj ⁡ ( A ) X ) ϵ + O ( ϵ 2 ) = det ( A ) tr ⁡ ( A − 1 X ) ϵ + O ( ϵ 2 ) {\\displaystyle \\det(A+\\epsilon X)-\\det(A)=\\operatorname {tr} (\\operatorname {adj} (A)X)\\epsilon +O\\left(\\epsilon ^{2}\\right)=\\det(A)\\operatorname {tr} \\left(A^{-1}X\\right)\\epsilon +O\\left(\\epsilon ^{2}\\right)} , using big O notation. The special case where A = I {\\displaystyle A=I} , the identity matrix, yields det ( I + ϵ X ) = 1 + tr ⁡ ( X ) ϵ + O ( ϵ 2 ) . {\\displaystyle \\det(I+\\epsilon X)=1+\\operatorname {tr} (X)\\epsilon +O\\left(\\epsilon ^{2}\\right).} This identity is used in describing Lie algebras associated to certain matrix Lie groups. For example, the special linear group SL n {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {SL} _{n}} is defined by the equation det A = 1 {\\displaystyle \\det A=1} . The above formula shows that its Lie algebra is the special linear Lie algebra s l n {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {sl}}_{n}} consisting of those matrices having trace zero. Writing a 3 × 3 {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3} matrix as A = [ a b c ] {\\displaystyle A={\\begin{bmatrix}a&b&c\\end{bmatrix}}} where a , b , c {\\displaystyle a,b,c} are column vectors of length 3, then the gradient over one of the three vectors may be written as the cross product of the other two: ∇ a det ( A ) = b × c ∇ b det ( A ) = c × a ∇ c det ( A ) = a × b . {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\nabla _{\\mathbf {a} }\\det(A)&=\\mathbf {b} \\times \\mathbf {c} \\\\\\nabla _{\\mathbf {b} }\\det(A)&=\\mathbf {c} \\times \\mathbf {a} \\\\\\nabla _{\\mathbf {c} }\\det(A)&=\\mathbf {a} \\times \\mathbf {b} .\\end{aligned}}} == History == Historically, determinants were used long before matrices: A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations. The determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero). In this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (九章算術, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). In Europe, solutions of linear systems of two equations were expressed by Cardano in 1545 by a determinant-like entity. Determinants proper originated separately from the work of Seki Takakazu in 1683 in Japan and parallelly of Leibniz in 1693. Cramer (1750) stated, without proof, Cramer's rule. Both Cramer and also Bézout (1779) were led to determinants by the question of plane curves passing through a given set of points. Vandermonde (1771) first recognized determinants as independent functions. Laplace (1772) gave the general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors: Vandermonde had already given a special case. Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities. Gauss (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the theory of numbers. He introduced the word \"determinant\" (Laplace had used \"resultant\"), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the discriminant of a quadratic form. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem. The next contributor of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m columns and n rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, Cauchy also presented one on the subject. (See Cauchy–Binet formula.) In this he used the word \"determinant\" in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's. With him begins the theory in its generality. Jacobi (1841) used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the Jacobian. In his memoirs in Crelle's Journal for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called alternants. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, Sylvester (1839) and Cayley began their work. Cayley 1841 introduced the modern notation for the determinant using vertical bars. The study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by Lebesgue, Hesse, and Sylvester; persymmetric determinants by Sylvester and Hankel; circulants by Catalan, Spottiswoode, Glaisher, and Scott; skew determinants and Pfaffians, in connection with the theory of orthogonal transformation, by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; Wronskians (so called by Muir) by Christoffel and Frobenius; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and Hessians by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by Trudi. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises. == Applications == === Cramer's rule === Determinants can be used to describe the solutions of a linear system of equations, written in matrix form as A x = b {\\displaystyle Ax=b} . This equation has a unique solution x {\\displaystyle x} if and only if det ( A ) {\\displaystyle \\det(A)} is nonzero. In this case, the solution is given by Cramer's rule: x i = det ( A i ) det ( A ) i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , n {\\displaystyle x_{i}={\\frac {\\det(A_{i})}{\\det(A)}}\\qquad i=1,2,3,\\ldots ,n} where A i {\\displaystyle A_{i}} is the matrix formed by replacing the i {\\displaystyle i} -th column of A {\\displaystyle A} by the column vector b {\\displaystyle b} . This follows immediately by column expansion of the determinant, i.e. det ( A i ) = det [ a 1 … b … a n ] {\\displaystyle \\det(A_{i})=\\det {\\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}&\\ldots &b&\\ldots &a_{n}\\end{bmatrix}}} = ∑ j = 1 n x j det [ a 1 … a i − 1 a j a i + 1 … a n ] = x i det ( A ) {\\displaystyle =\\sum _{j=1}^{n}x_{j}\\det {\\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}&\\ldots &a_{i-1}&a_{j}&a_{i+1}&\\ldots &a_{n}\\end{bmatrix}}=x_{i}\\det(A)} where the vectors a j {\\displaystyle a_{j}} are the columns of A. The rule is also implied by the identity A adj ⁡ ( A ) = adj ⁡ ( A ) A = det ( A ) I n . {\\displaystyle A\\,\\operatorname {adj} (A)=\\operatorname {adj} (A)\\,A=\\det(A)\\,I_{n}.} Cramer's rule can be implemented in O ⁡ ( n 3 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {O} (n^{3})} time, which is comparable to more common methods of solving systems of linear equations, such as LU, QR, or singular value decomposition. === Linear independence === Determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors: det A {\\displaystyle \\det A} is zero if and only if the column vectors of the matrix A {\\displaystyle A} are linearly dependent. For example, given two linearly independent vectors v 1 , v 2 ∈ R 3 {\\displaystyle v_{1},v_{2}\\in \\mathbf {R} ^{3}} , a third vector v 3 {\\displaystyle v_{3}} lies in the plane spanned by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the 3 × 3 {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3} matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of differential equations: given functions f 1 ( x ) , … , f n ( x ) {\\displaystyle f_{1}(x),\\dots ,f_{n}(x)} (supposed to be n − 1 {\\displaystyle n-1} times differentiable), the Wronskian is defined to be W ( f 1 , … , f n ) ( x ) = | f 1 ( x ) f 2 ( x ) ⋯ f n ( x ) f 1 ′ ( x ) f 2 ′ ( x ) ⋯ f n ′ ( x ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ f 1 ( n − 1 ) ( x ) f 2 ( n − 1 ) ( x ) ⋯ f n ( n − 1 ) ( x ) | . {\\displaystyle W(f_{1},\\ldots ,f_{n})(x)={\\begin{vmatrix}f_{1}(x)&f_{2}(x)&\\cdots &f_{n}(x)\\\\f_{1}'(x)&f_{2}'(x)&\\cdots &f_{n}'(x)\\\\\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\f_{1}^{(n-1)}(x)&f_{2}^{(n-1)}(x)&\\cdots &f_{n}^{(n-1)}(x)\\end{vmatrix}}.} It is non-zero (for some x {\\displaystyle x} ) in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order n − 1 {\\displaystyle n-1} are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of analytic functions, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See the Wronskian and linear independence. Another such use of the determinant is the resultant, which gives a criterion when two polynomials have a common root. === Orientation of a basis === The determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every sequence of n vectors in Rn, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. The determinant will be nonzero if and only if the sequence of vectors is a basis for Rn. In that case, the sign of the determinant determines whether the orientation of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the standard basis. In the case of an orthogonal basis, the magnitude of the determinant is equal to the product of the lengths of the basis vectors. For instance, an orthogonal matrix with entries in Rn represents an orthonormal basis in Euclidean space, and hence has determinant of ±1 (since all the vectors have length 1). The determinant is +1 if and only if the basis has the same orientation. It is −1 if and only if the basis has the opposite orientation. More generally, if the determinant of A is positive, A represents an orientation-preserving linear transformation (if A is an orthogonal 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 matrix, this is a rotation), while if it is negative, A switches the orientation of the basis. === Volume and Jacobian determinant === As pointed out above, the absolute value of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if f : R n → R n {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbf {R} ^{n}\\to \\mathbf {R} ^{n}} is the linear map given by multiplication with a matrix A {\\displaystyle A} , and S ⊂ R n {\\displaystyle S\\subset \\mathbf {R} ^{n}} is any measurable subset, then the volume of f ( S ) {\\displaystyle f(S)} is given by | det ( A ) | {\\displaystyle |\\det(A)|} times the volume of S {\\displaystyle S} . More generally, if the linear map f : R n → R m {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbf {R} ^{n}\\to \\mathbf {R} ^{m}} is represented by the m × n {\\displaystyle m\\times n} matrix A {\\displaystyle A} , then the ratio between the n {\\displaystyle n} -dimensional volumes of f ( S ) {\\displaystyle f(S)} and S {\\displaystyle S} is given by: volume ⁡ ( f ( S ) ) volume ⁡ ( S ) = det ( A T A ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\operatorname {volume} (f(S))}{\\operatorname {volume} (S)}}={\\sqrt {\\det \\left(A^{\\textsf {T}}A\\right)}}.} When m < n {\\displaystyle m 2 {\\displaystyle a>2} , then there is an algorithm computing the determinant in time O ( M ( n ) ) {\\displaystyle O(M(n))} . This means, for example, that an O ⁡ ( n 2.376 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {O} (n^{2.376})} algorithm for computing the determinant exists based on the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm. This exponent has been further lowered, as of 2016, to 2.373. In addition to the complexity of the algorithm, further criteria can be used to compare algorithms. Especially for applications concerning matrices over rings, algorithms that compute the determinant without any divisions exist. (By contrast, Gauss elimination requires divisions.) One such algorithm, having complexity O ⁡ ( n 4 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {O} (n^{4})} is based on the following idea: one replaces permutations (as in the Leibniz rule) by so-called closed ordered walks, in which several items can be repeated. The resulting sum has more terms than in the Leibniz rule, but in the process several of these products can be reused, making it more efficient than naively computing with the Leibniz rule. Algorithms can also be assessed according to their bit complexity, i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the Gaussian elimination (or LU decomposition) method is of order O ⁡ ( n 3 ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {O} (n^{3})} , but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long. By comparison, the Bareiss Algorithm, is an exact-division method (so it does use division, but only in cases where these divisions can be performed without remainder) is of the same order, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times n {\\displaystyle n} . If the determinant of A and the inverse of A have already been computed, the matrix determinant lemma allows rapid calculation of the determinant of A + uvT, where u and v are column vectors. Charles Dodgson (i.e. Lewis Carroll of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland fame) invented a method for computing determinants called Dodgson condensation. Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form. == See also == == Notes == == References == Anton, Howard (2005), Elementary Linear Algebra (Applications Version) (9th ed.), Wiley International Axler, Sheldon Jay (2015).

In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible and the corresponding linear map is an isomorphism.

Adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant.

This implies that, given a linear endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space, the determinant of the matrix that represents it on a basis does not depend on the chosen basis.

Due to the sine this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. u⊥ = (−c, a), so that |u⊥| |v| cos θ′ becomes the signed area in question, which can be determined by the pattern of the scalar product to be equal to ad − bc according to the following equations: Signed area = | u | | v | sin θ = | u ⊥ | | v | cos θ ′ = ( − c a ) ⋅ ( b d ) = a d − b c .",

Adding a scalar multiple of one column to another column does not change the value of the determinant.

In this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (九章算術, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). In Europe, solutions of linear systems of two equations were expressed by Cardano in 1545 by a determinant-like entity. Determinants proper originated separately from the work of Seki Takakazu in 1683 in Japan and parallelly of Leibniz in 1693. Cramer (1750) stated, without proof, Cramer's rule. Both Cramer and also Bézout (1779) were led to determinants by the question of plane curves passing through a given set of points.

Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities. Gauss (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the theory of numbers. He introduced the word \"determinant\" (Laplace had used \"resultant\"), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the discriminant of a quadratic form. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem. The next contributor of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m columns and n rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.",

In this he used the word \"determinant\" in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's. With him begins the theory in its generality. Jacobi (1841) used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the Jacobian. In his memoirs in Crelle's Journal for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called alternants. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, Sylvester (1839) and Cayley began their work. Cayley 1841 introduced the modern notation for the determinant using vertical bars. The study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory.",

        "question": "How does the geometric interpretation of a determinant for a 2D matrix generalize to an n-dimensional matrix?",
        "answer": "For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant represents the signed area of the parallelogram that is the image of the unit square, with its absolute value acting as the area scale factor. This concept generalizes to an n x n matrix, which maps the unit n-cube to an n-dimensional parallelotope. The determinant of the n x n matrix gives the signed n-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, thereby describing the n-dimensional volume scale factor of the linear transformation.",

        "question": "What are the different notations for the determinant of a square matrix, and what are two equivalent ways it can be defined?",
        "answer": "The determinant of a square matrix A can be denoted as det(A), or by replacing the matrix's brackets with enclosing vertical bars. Two equivalent ways to define the determinant are via the Leibniz formula, an explicit formula involving sums of products of matrix entries, or by characterizing it as the unique function of the matrix's entries that satisfies certain properties.",
