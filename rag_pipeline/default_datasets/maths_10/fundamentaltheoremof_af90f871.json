Roughly speaking, the two operations can be thought of as inverses of each other. The first part of the theorem, the first fundamental theorem of calculus, states that for a continuous function f , an antiderivative or indefinite integral F can be obtained as the integral of f over an interval with a variable upper bound. Conversely, the second part of the theorem, the second fundamental theorem of calculus, states that the integral of a function f over a fixed interval is equal to the change of any antiderivative F between the ends of the interval. This greatly simplifies the calculation of a definite integral provided an antiderivative can be found by symbolic integration, thus avoiding numerical integration. == History == The fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to compute area via infinitesimals, an operation that we would now call integration. The origins of differentiation likewise predate the fundamental theorem of calculus by hundreds of years; for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of continuity of functions and motion were studied by the Oxford Calculators and other scholars. The historical relevance of the fundamental theorem of calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of gradients) are actually closely related. Calculus as a unified theory of integration and differentiation started from the conjecture and the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character, was by James Gregory (1638–1675). Isaac Barrow (1630–1677) proved a more generalized version of the theorem, while his student Isaac Newton (1642–1727) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory. Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today. == Sketch of geometric proof == The first fundamental theorem may be interpreted as follows. Given a continuous function y = f ( x ) {\\displaystyle y=f(x)} whose graph is plotted as a curve, one defines a corresponding \"area function\" x ↦ A ( x ) {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto A(x)} such that A(x) is the area beneath the curve between 0 and x. The area A(x) may not be easily computable, but it is assumed to be well defined. The area under the curve between x and x + h could be computed by finding the area between 0 and x + h, then subtracting the area between 0 and x. In other words, the area of this \"strip\" would be A(x + h) − A(x). There is another way to estimate the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, h is multiplied by f(x) to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So: A ( x + h ) − A ( x ) ≈ f ( x ) ⋅ h {\\displaystyle A(x+h)-A(x)\\approx f(x)\\cdot h} Dividing by h on both sides, we get: A ( x + h ) − A ( x ) h ≈ f ( x ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}\\approx f(x)} This estimate becomes a perfect equality when h approaches 0: f ( x ) = lim h → 0 A ( x + h ) − A ( x ) h = def A ′ ( x ) . {\\displaystyle f(x)=\\lim _{h\\to 0}{\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}\\ {\\stackrel {\\text{def}}{=}}\\ A'(x).} That is, the derivative of the area function A(x) exists and is equal to the original function f(x), so the area function is an antiderivative of the original function. Thus, the derivative of the integral of a function (the area) is the original function, so that derivative and integral are inverse operations which reverse each other. This is the essence of the Fundamental Theorem. == Intuitive understanding == Intuitively, the fundamental theorem states that integration and differentiation are inverse operations which reverse each other. The second fundamental theorem says that the sum of infinitesimal changes in a quantity (the integral of the derivative of the quantity) adds up to the net change in the quantity. To visualize this, imagine traveling in a car and wanting to know the distance traveled (the net change in position along the highway). You can see the velocity on the speedometer but cannot look out to see your location. Each second, you can find how far the car has traveled using distance = speed × time, that is, multiplying the current speed (in kilometers or miles per hour) by the time interval (1 second = 1 3600 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{3600}}} hour). By summing up all these small steps, you can approximate the total distance traveled, in spite of not looking outside the car: distance traveled = ∑ ( velocity at each time ) × ( time interval ) = ∑ v t × Δ t . {\\displaystyle {\\text{distance traveled}}=\\sum \\left({\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{velocity at}}\\\\{\\text{each time}}\\end{array}}\\right)\\times \\left({\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{time}}\\\\{\\text{interval}}\\end{array}}\\right)=\\sum v_{t}\\times \\Delta t.} As Δ t {\\displaystyle \\Delta t} becomes infinitesimally small, the summing up corresponds to integration. Thus, the integral of the velocity function (the derivative of position) computes how far the car has traveled (the net change in position). The first fundamental theorem says that the value of any function is the rate of change (the derivative) of its integral from a fixed starting point up to any chosen end point. Continuing the above example using a velocity as the function, you can integrate it from the starting time up to any given time to obtain a distance function whose derivative is that velocity. (To obtain your highway-marker position, you would need to add your starting position to this integral and to take into account whether your travel was in the direction of increasing or decreasing mile markers.) == Formal statements == There are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an antiderivative, while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals. === First part === This part is sometimes referred to as the first fundamental theorem of calculus. Let f be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. Let F be the function defined, for all x in [a, b], by F ( x ) = ∫ a x f ( t ) d t . {\\displaystyle F(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt.} Then F is uniformly continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and F ′ ( x ) = f ( x ) {\\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x)} for all x in (a, b) so F is an antiderivative of f. === Corollary === The fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function f {\\displaystyle f} for which an antiderivative F {\\displaystyle F} is known. Specifically, if f {\\displaystyle f} is a real-valued continuous function on [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} and F {\\displaystyle F} is an antiderivative of f {\\displaystyle f} in [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} , then ∫ a b f ( t ) d t = F ( b ) − F ( a ) . {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(t)\\,dt=F(b)-F(a).} The corollary assumes continuity on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem. === Second part === This part is sometimes referred to as the second fundamental theorem of calculus or the Newton–Leibniz theorem. Let f {\\displaystyle f} be a real-valued function on a closed interval [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} and F {\\displaystyle F} a continuous function on [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} which is an antiderivative of f {\\displaystyle f} in ( a , b ) {\\displaystyle (a,b)} : F ′ ( x ) = f ( x ) . {\\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x).} If f {\\displaystyle f} is Riemann integrable on [ a , b ] {\\displaystyle [a,b]} then ∫ a b f ( x ) d x = F ( b ) − F ( a ) . {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx=F(b)-F(a).} The second part is somewhat stronger than the corollary because it does not assume that f {\\displaystyle f} is continuous. When an antiderivative F {\\displaystyle F} of f {\\displaystyle f} exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for f {\\displaystyle f} , obtained by adding an arbitrary constant to F {\\displaystyle F} . Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of f {\\displaystyle f} always exist when f {\\displaystyle f} is continuous. == Proof of the first part == For a given function f, define the function F(x) as F ( x ) = ∫ a x f ( t ) d t . {\\displaystyle F(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt.} For any two numbers x1 and x1 + Δx in [a, b], we have F ( x 1 + Δ x ) − F ( x 1 ) = ∫ a x 1 + Δ x f ( t ) d t − ∫ a x 1 f ( t ) d t = ∫ x 1 x 1 + Δ x f ( t ) d t , {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}F(x_{1}+\\Delta x)-F(x_{1})&=\\int _{a}^{x_{1}+\\Delta x}f(t)\\,dt-\\int _{a}^{x_{1}}f(t)\\,dt\\\\&=\\int _{x_{1}}^{x_{1}+\\Delta x}f(t)\\,dt,\\end{aligned}}} the latter equality resulting from the basic properties of integrals and the additivity of areas. According to the mean value theorem for integration, there exists a real number c ∈ [ x 1 , x 1 + Δ x ] {\\displaystyle c\\in [x_{1},x_{1}+\\Delta x]} such that ∫ x 1 x 1 + Δ x f ( t ) d t = f ( c ) ⋅ Δ x . {\\displaystyle \\int _{x_{1}}^{x_{1}+\\Delta x}f(t)\\,dt=f(c)\\cdot \\Delta x.} It follows that F ( x 1 + Δ x ) − F ( x 1 ) = f ( c ) ⋅ Δ x , {\\displaystyle F(x_{1}+\\Delta x)-F(x_{1})=f(c)\\cdot \\Delta x,} and thus that F ( x 1 + Δ x ) − F ( x 1 ) Δ x = f ( c ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {F(x_{1}+\\Delta x)-F(x_{1})}{\\Delta x}}=f(c).} Taking the limit as Δ x → 0 , {\\displaystyle \\Delta x\\to 0,} and keeping in mind that c ∈ [ x 1 , x 1 + Δ x ] , {\\displaystyle c\\in [x_{1},x_{1}+\\Delta x],} one gets lim Δ x → 0 F ( x 1 + Δ x ) − F ( x 1 ) Δ x = lim Δ x → 0 f ( c ) , {\\displaystyle \\lim _{\\Delta x\\to 0}{\\frac {F(x_{1}+\\Delta x)-F(x_{1})}{\\Delta x}}=\\lim _{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(c),} that is, F ′ ( x 1 ) = f ( x 1 ) , {\\displaystyle F'(x_{1})=f(x_{1}),} according to the definition of the derivative, the continuity of f, and the squeeze theorem. == Proof of the corollary == Suppose F is an antiderivative of f, with f continuous on [a, b]. Let G ( x ) = ∫ a x f ( t ) d t . {\\displaystyle G(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt.} By the first part of the theorem, we know G is also an antiderivative of f. Since F′ − G′ = 0 the mean value theorem implies that F − G is a constant function, that is, there is a number c such that G(x) = F(x) + c for all x in [a, b]. Letting x = a, we have F ( a ) + c = G ( a ) = ∫ a a f ( t ) d t = 0 , {\\displaystyle F(a)+c=G(a)=\\int _{a}^{a}f(t)\\,dt=0,} which means c = −F(a). In other words, G(x) = F(x) − F(a), and so ∫ a b f ( x ) d x = G ( b ) = F ( b ) − F ( a ) . {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx=G(b)=F(b)-F(a).} == Proof of the second part == This is a limit proof by Riemann sums. To begin, we recall the mean value theorem. Stated briefly, if F is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) such that F ′ ( c ) ( b − a ) = F ( b ) − F ( a ) . {\\displaystyle F'(c)(b-a)=F(b)-F(a).} Let f be (Riemann) integrable on the interval [a, b], and let f admit an antiderivative F on (a, b) such that F is continuous on [a, b]. Begin with the quantity F(b) − F(a). Let there be numbers x0, ..., xn such that a = x 0 < x 1 < x 2 < ⋯ < x n − 1 < x n = b . {\\displaystyle a=x_{0}"

The geometric proof defines an area function, A(x), as the integral of a function f(x).

Similarly, the car analogy explains that one can find the total distance traveled (a net change) by summing up infinitesimal changes in distance, which is the integral of the velocity (the derivative of position). This shows that integrating a rate of change yields the net change in the original quantity, again highlighting the inverse relationship between the two operations.",

The area of a small strip under this curve between x and x + h is calculated as A(x + h) - A(x). This area can also be approximated by the area of a rectangle of height f(x) and width h. This leads to the approximation A(x + h) - A(x) ≈ f(x) * h. By dividing by h, we get the expression (A(x + h) - A(x)) / h ≈ f(x). When the limit is taken as h approaches 0, this approximation becomes an exact equality. The left side of the equation becomes the definition of the derivative of A(x), resulting in A'(x) = f(x). This demonstrates that the derivative of the area function is the original function, meaning the area function is an antiderivative of the original function.",

To find the total distance a car has traveled, one can sum up many small distances calculated by multiplying the car's velocity by a small time interval.

Therefore, the integral of the velocity function (the derivative of position) over a period of time computes the net change in position, or the total distance traveled.

The mean value theorem for integration is applied to this integral, allowing it to be rewritten as f(c) ⋅ Δx for some c in the interval [x1, x1 + Δx]. This expression is then rearranged into the difference quotient form: (F(x1 + Δx) - F(x1)) / Δx = f(c).
