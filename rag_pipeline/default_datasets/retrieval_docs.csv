"There’s even evidence that a 6-foot deer fence works most of the time. Some years back various Connecticut towns banned all fencing over 6 feet high. The local deer fence installers shook their heads but went ahead and installed a bunch of 6-foot deer fences. To their surprise, the fences worked pretty well. High enough to reliably keep out deer. That’s not so high as you might think. The literature says white-tailed deer can jump as high as 12 or even 15 feet. But they generally don’t, because Nature tells them not to. After all, what goes up must come down, and a deer with a broken leg is unlikely to survive",{'doc_id': '132_5'}

The fences or walls around the handling facility must be of sufficient height that deer will not attempt to jump. For most deer 2.5 m (8') is adequate but white-tailed deer and elk require at least 2.7 m (9').

"Just because you have a fence doesn't mean it will be effective at keeping out deer. There are several facts you need to keep in mind when installing such a fence. Height, or width, is probably the most important factor with deer fences, especially if high deer pressure. White-tailed deer can jump almost eight feet high, so effective upright fences against them should be this high. Deer may be able to jump high, but not both high and over a distance. So a fence may not be as high, perhaps six feet, but slanted outward. The deer will try walking under the fence and meet resistance. If you have a standard fence about four or five feet feet high, you can add a similar and additional one about four feet away. While not high, with this width deer usually wont like to try and clear both and perhaps get caught between or on them.",{'doc_id': '132_8'}

"[A] self-insured retention (“SIR”) differs from a deductible in that a SIR is an amount that an insured retains and covers before insurance coverage begins to apply. Once a SIR is satisfied, the insurer is then liable for amounts exceeding the retention less any agreed deductible. . . . . . In contrast, a deductible is an amount that an insurer subtracts from a policy amount, reducing the amount of insurance. With a deductible, the insurer has the liability and defense risk from the beginning and then deducts the deductible amount from the insured coverage.[27].",{'doc_id': '14_0'}
"In an insurance policy, the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses.

A self-insured retention means that the insured carries a fixed amount of risk, including adjusting and legal expenses. The insurance policy, whether a primary or umbrella contract, is excess coverage above the SIR.",{'doc_id': '14_2'}
"If you are self-employed, you may be eligible to deduct premiums that you pay for medical, dental and qualifying long-term care insurance coverage for yourself, your spouse and your dependents.

"However, there are important differences in the way they operate. Insurance policies written with deductibles provide that the insurer will pay the defense and indemnity costs in connection with a covered claim, and then charge or bill back the deductible amount to the insured. Another difference between a deductible and a SIR is that the SIR does not reduce available policy limits, whereas a deductible may reduce policy limits.

"The average person walks between 3,000 and 4,000 steps per day. To find out how many steps you take each day, buy a pedometer similar to the one in the video at the bottom of this page. Clip it firmly to your belt or waistband, and it will measure every step you take: around the house, across the office, window shopping, to school or the park. Walking is classed as a moderate-intensity activity and counts towards your recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise. If you walk 10,000 steps a day, you will probably do more than 150 minutes and that's great: research suggests that the more activity you do the better, as there are numerous benefits of exercise.",{'doc_id': '828_0'}

"A historic brick building in Germany covered with EIFS on the right side. Exterior insulation and finishing system (EIFS) is a general class of non-load bearing building cladding systems that provides exterior walls with an insulated, water-resistant, finished surface in an integrated composite material system. EIFS before 2000 was a barrier system, meaning the EIFS system itself was the weather barrier. After 2000 the EIFS industry introduced the air/moisture barrier that resides behind the foam.",{'doc_id': '98_2'}
"There are two types of EIFS systems, barrier and drainable. Barrier, the earlier type, typically applied the insulating polystyrene board directly to the exterior sheathing with adhesive, followed by base coat, mesh and finish coat. There is no provision to deal with moisture that can be trapped if the system leaks. The most basic and common EIFS is called a barrier EIFS (also known as a traditional or conventional EIFS). Another type is called an EIFS with Drainage, which is a barrier EIFS to which a water drainage capability has been added.",{'doc_id': '98_3'}
Fundamentals. All EIFS are proprietary systems and the components of the system should not be modified beyond the limits stated in the manufacturer's literature. The design of the interface with other components of the wall system is the responsibility of the wall designer. EIFS is available in two basic types: a barrier wall system or a wall drainage system. Barrier EIFS wall systems rely primarily on the base coat portion of the exterior skin to resist water penetration.,{'doc_id': '98_4'}

"First, to make things complicated, there are two types of EIFS: PB systems and PM systems.
