This amount should account for all tasks, including billable work, invoicing, and bookkeeping.

In the court case *Watson v. Commissioner*, an S-Corp owner paid himself a $24,000 salary while taking over $175,000 in distributions. The IRS determined this was too low and, based on a study of peer salaries, established a reasonable salary of $93,000.

However, if the sole shareholder is the only person generating revenue, it is difficult to justify that the S-Corp earned more than the value of your work. In such cases, it may be reasonable for all profits to be considered salary.

Because business owners are more likely to be audited, it is recommended to consult an accountant or attorney to help determine an appropriate and defensible salary."

This helps determine whether a pay-per-minute or a flat-rate service is more suitable.

Here are some alternatives:

*   **Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP):** This service uses your existing internet connection. You can use a regular phone with a VOIP adapter box or use software on your computer. Plans range from pay-per-minute to monthly or yearly subscriptions. Some providers mentioned are Anveo, Callcentric, Skype, and UberConference. Free calls are often possible between customers of the same VOIP service.
*   **Cell Phone Only:** You can save money by simply not having a home phone service. However, be aware of downsides like battery life and potentially less reliable 911 service.
*   **Bare Minimum Landline:** Your local phone company may be required to offer a basic, unadvertised service that only provides a dial tone. You will need to call and ask for it.

When choosing a service, check for discounts through work, school, or other associations. It is also recommended to avoid long-term contracts at first, as month-to-month plans can be cheaper."

### Strategy 1: Start with Research
*   Spend your initial money on research materials to learn about investing and stock market analysis.
*   Research company filings for Canadian companies at `sedar.com`, U.S. companies at `edgar.com`, and European companies at the UK's Companies House website.
*   Use resources like The Motley Fool or The Globe & Mail's daily column to find different stock-picking strategies and analysis.
*   Open a free practice account with a bank or stock house to test your strategies without risking real money.

### Strategy 2: Invest in Funds
*   For beginners, especially with small amounts of capital, it is recommended to start with mutual funds or low-cost index funds rather than individual stocks. This spreads your investment across many companies, reducing risk.
*   When investing small amounts, avoiding commissions is crucial. Look for a free online brokerage that offers no-load, commission-free mutual funds.
*   Pay close attention to the fund's expense ratio. Index funds often have much lower fees (e.g., 0.05%) than other mutual funds (e.g., 1%), which can significantly impact your long-term returns.
*   Be aware that some funds require a minimum investment, which could be $100 or more.

### Strategy 3: Picking Individual Stocks
*   This approach is considered risky for beginners. If you choose this path, one suggestion is to limit it to less than 5% of your total investments.
*   With small investment amounts, commissions for buying and selling can easily eliminate any profits. It may be impractical until you have more money saved.
*   One strategy for picking stocks is to look for ""unicorn companies"" that have a long, uninterrupted history of paying and increasing dividends, and whose share price has a history of increasing."

*   **Psychological Motivation:** The ""debt snowball"" method involves paying off the smallest debts first. Achieving these quick wins can provide motivation and a sense of accomplishment, encouraging a person to stick with their debt reduction plan.
*   **Risk Management:** It can be rational to first pay off a lower-interest loan if defaulting on it has more severe consequences. For example, defaulting on a low-interest mortgage could lead to foreclosure, which is a worse outcome than defaulting on a high-interest, unsecured credit card.
*   **Cash Flow:** Eliminating a smaller loan frees up its monthly payment. This increased cash flow can be applied to the next debt or provide a safety cushion for those with fluctuating incomes.
*   **Convenience:** Having fewer debts simplifies life by reducing the number of bills to track, statements to manage, and potential late fees. It can also be a priority to eliminate a debt from a lender with poor customer service.
*   **Strategic Financial Reasons:**
    *   A loan may have a low introductory rate that will soon increase, making it wise to pay it off before the rate jumps.
    *   Paying off revolving debt, like a credit card, frees up a line of credit, which provides liquidity in case of an emergency.
    *   Some loans have flat fees that are eliminated only when the balance is paid in full."

*   **Financial Advantage of Paying Extra:** It is financially better to pay extra on your loan each month. Interest accrues daily on your outstanding balance, so the faster you reduce the principal, the less total interest you will pay over the life of the loan. This strategy pays off the loan faster and saves you money, especially if your loan's interest rate is higher than your savings account's rate.

*   **Benefit of Saving:** The main advantage of saving money instead of applying it directly to the loan is liquidity. Having cash available in an emergency fund can provide a safety net in case of job loss, illness, or other unexpected major expenses.

*   **A Recommended Strategy:** A balanced approach is often suggested. First, build a sufficient emergency fund (e.g., $1,000 for each potential large expense). After your emergency fund is established, apply all extra money toward paying off the high-interest loan as quickly as possible."

*   **Financial Distress:** A low P/B ratio can be a warning that a company is in trouble. The market may anticipate that the company lacks cash flow and will have to sell its assets at a discount to survive, driving the stock price below book value.
*   **Asset Valuation Mismatch:** A company may have a high book value due to assets like valuable real estate, but if those assets don't generate sufficient cash flow, investors may largely disregard them when pricing the stock.

### Simple Rules of Thumb:

*   A rough rule is to take the annual salary in thousands and use that as the hourly rate. For example, a $55,000/year job would translate to a $55/hour contractor rate.
*   Another method is to determine the full-time hourly rate and double it. For a $50,000/year salary, the full-time rate is about $25/hour, so the part-time or contractor rate would be around $50/hour.

### Why the Rate is Higher:

The part-time or contractor rate is typically 1.5 to 2 times higher than the equivalent full-time employee rate to compensate for:
*   Lack of benefits like health insurance, paid time off, and 401k matching.
*   The need to pay the full FICA tax, of which an employer normally pays half.
*   Less job stability and no guarantee of work availability.
*   The company has less financial and legal overhead.

### Detailed Calculation:

For a more precise conversion:
1.  Calculate your full-time job's total annual compensation by adding your salary to the monetary value of all your benefits (e.g., health insurance, bonuses, 401k matching).
2.  Factor in additional costs you will now bear, such as the employer's half of FICA taxes (about 7.8%).
3.  Calculate your total annual part-time hours (e.g., 20 hours/week x 52 weeks = 1040 hours).
4.  Divide your total annual compensation by the total part-time hours to find the equivalent hourly rate."

### 0% Financing

*   **Fees:** The ""0% interest"" offer may come with an upfront fee. For a $22,500 car, a $1500 fee is equivalent to a 1.1% APR.
*   **Insurance:** Lenders may require you to carry more expensive, comprehensive insurance than you would otherwise choose.
*   **Credit Impact:** An installment loan can help your credit score, which may lead to a better mortgage rate. However, the debt itself could make it harder to qualify for a mortgage.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** Financing frees up your cash, which could be invested to potentially earn more than the cost of the financing fee.

### Paying with Cash

*   **Cost:** The cash price is $22,500, avoiding the $1500 financing fee and any potential for higher interest rates.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** You lose the opportunity to invest the $22,500. To make financing worthwhile, your investments would need to safely earn more than the financing fee. Safe, low-risk investments (like CDs) may only offer returns around 1-2%.
*   **Net Worth:** From a mortgage lender's perspective, paying with a large amount of cash from savings can reduce your net worth, similar to taking on debt.

### Alternative Option

*   Consider taking a cash-back offer from the dealer and securing a separate auto loan from a bank or credit union, which may offer a better deal than the dealer's financing."

Here's why:

*   **It's not for small amounts:** For an investment firm, the administrative, legal, and compliance costs of managing a small account would exceed any potential profit from your capital. These models, like hedge funds, are reserved for wealthy, qualified investors who can provide enough capital to make the arrangement worthwhile for the manager.

*   **The risk is imbalanced:** A manager taking on the risk of your losses would have to invest very conservatively to protect themselves, leading to minimal returns for you. In a significant market downturn, a firm covering 50% of its clients' losses could be wiped out.

*   **Better alternatives for managers:** A skilled investor with enough money to cover your potential losses would rather invest their own capital and keep 100% of the gains. They have little need for your money.

*   **Alternatives exist:** Hedge funds and venture capital firms use a similar model (like the ""2 and 20"" rule) where they take a percentage of profits.

The feeling of being debt-free and focusing on a single goal may help you eliminate the debt faster, even if it's not the best mathematical choice.

**Investment and Income Strategies:**

*   **Financial Portfolio:** Invest the money like a university endowment. This could potentially generate $15,000–$21,000 per year (5-7% of the principal). However, be aware that a market downturn could significantly reduce your capital, so you would need to live frugally.

This can provide consistent income with minimal effort. Another option is to buy a ""mother-daughter"" property, live in one unit, and rent out the other.
*   **Business Ownership:** Buy or start a business, such as a franchise, and hire a general manager to run it. This approach is risky and likely requires a few years of hands-on involvement to ensure it becomes self-sufficient.

**Lifestyle Adjustments:**

*   **Delta Hedge:** This is a more complex strategy that involves holding the long call option while shorting the underlying stock. This can be done by borrowing the stock to short or by creating a ""synthetic short"" (a combination of a long put and a short call). This approach requires actively trading the stock to maintain a hedge ratio and may only result in breaking even.

*   **Pattern Day Trader Rule:** In the U.S., executing four or more day trades within five business days can classify you as a ""pattern day trader,"" which requires you to maintain a $25,000 minimum balance in your account. Failure to do so can result in your account being locked.
*   **Taxes:** Profits from securities held for less than a year are considered short-term capital gains and are taxed at your higher, ordinary income tax rate.
*   **Risk of Loss:** The strategy assumes a stock's price will rise before it falls. Your sell order could be triggered at a loss first. You also risk your capital being tied up for long periods if a stock's price declines after you buy and doesn't recover.

*   **Short-Term Capital Gains Tax:** There is no special rate for short-term capital gains; they are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. For example, if you are in the 25% tax bracket, your gain is taxed at 25%. Only the gain itself is taxable, not the original investment amount.

*   **IRA Withdrawal Tax:** An early withdrawal from a traditional IRA is taxed at your ordinary income rate plus a 10% penalty. For someone in the 25% bracket, this would be a total of 35%. The entire amount withdrawn is considered taxable income.

retrieval,"Starting an investment portfolio with Rs 5,000/-","{""true_qrel_list"": [""272021"", ""472585""]}","Based on the information provided, here are two strategies for starting an investment portfolio with a small amount:

**1. Fixed Deposit (FD) Laddering**

*   **Strategy:** Split your initial amount and invest in FDs of different durations, for example, 30, 60, and 90 days.
*   **Process:** When the 30-day FD matures, you can either use the money or reinvest it into a new 90-day FD. This creates a cycle where an FD matures every 30 days, providing you with flexibility.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Longer FD cycles (e.g., 6, 12, 18 months) generally offer higher interest rates.
    *   Interest is typically paid every three months, not monthly.
    *   Managing renewals can be time-consuming if your bank doesn't offer online services for it.

**2. Hedged Stock Investment**

*   **Argument against FDs:** Short-term FDs are unlikely to offer high returns (e.g., 8-9%), and high inflation may result in a net loss of money in real terms.
*   **Alternative Strategy:** Buy a stock you believe will increase in value and, to limit your risk, also buy a put option on that same stock.
*   **Benefit:** If the stock price falls, you can exercise the option, and your loss will be limited to the premium you paid for the option."

*   **Industry Standard:** The standard set by most securities exchanges is ""T+3,"" meaning trades are completed three days after they are initiated. This period is for the formal settlement where funds and securities are exchanged between the multiple parties involved.
*   **Transaction Complexity:** A sale involves you, your broker (Schwab), the buyer, and the buyer's broker. Your order may be aggregated with others and filled by multiple counterparties. The three-day period allows banks to coordinate and reconcile these complex transactions.
*   **Financial Incentive:** Some argue that brokers use this settlement period to earn interest on the money (known as ""float"") before it is transferred to you.

*   **Fees and Penalties:** Banks can charge late payment fees or apply high deferred interest rates if a borrower misses a payment.
*   **Upfront Loan Fees:** Some 0% loans come with an upfront loan fee, typically 2-3% of the total amount.

### **Pros**
*   The primary advantage is the potential for the investment's returns (from capital growth and dividends) to be higher than the mortgage's interest rate.
*   It's a form of leveraged investing, allowing you to take advantage of what may be a cheap source of money to potentially generate profit.

### **Cons**
*   **Investment Risk:** The fund's performance is not guaranteed, while the mortgage interest is a guaranteed cost. The investment can lose value, and you could lose more than you started with.
*   **Interest Rate Risk:** A fixed mortgage rate is only for a set period. If the investment is down when the mortgage is up for renewal, interest rates may have risen, making the strategy much less attractive or unprofitable.
*   **Currency Risk:** If you borrow in one currency (e.g., Canadian dollars) to invest in a fund based in another (e.g., U.S. dollars), you can lose money from unfavorable exchange rate shifts even if the investment itself gains value.
*   **Income Mismatch:** The income from fund dividends is not guaranteed, is variable, and is unlikely to cover the mortgage interest payments on its own.
*   **Historical Failures:** Similar strategies have failed disastrously in the past, such as the UK's ""endowment mortgage"" scandals, where poor stock performance left people unable to pay off their loans."

*   **For a mortgage:** The phrase can refer to an ""assumable mortgage."" This is a formal financial arrangement where a buyer takes on the seller's outstanding mortgage and its terms, transferring the loan to their name."

*   **Financial Priorities and Better Returns:** It is more important to first build an emergency fund, pay off higher-interest debt (like credit cards), and take advantage of employer 401(k) matching programs, which can offer an immediate high return on investment.
*   **Liquidity:** Money used to pay off a loan is no longer accessible. Keeping cash provides a liquid asset for emergencies, such as job loss or medical expenses, or for opportunities like a down payment on a house.
*   **Favorable Loan Conditions:** If the loan's interest rate is lower than the rate of inflation, the debt becomes cheaper to pay back over time. Additionally, student loan interest is tax-deductible in the U.S., which lowers the loan's effective interest rate.
*   **Potential for Forgiveness:** Delaying aggressive repayment keeps open the possibility of loan forgiveness or dismissal, which can occur under specific circumstances, such as working in certain professions (e.g., teaching) or becoming disabled."

*   **Rebalancing:** You can use the rollover as an opportunity to rebalance your portfolio. However, you can also rebalance at any time, regardless of the rollover.
*   **Market timing:** If you are concerned about a market downturn right before the transfer, you can move your funds into a money market account a few weeks beforehand for safety. This should only be done if it aligns with your overall retirement goals.

While it can be a good strategy for many, there are several factors to consider first.

**Priorities before maxing out your 401k:**
*   **Contribute enough to get the company match:** This is considered a top priority, as it's like getting a guaranteed return on your investment.
*   **Establish an emergency fund:** Set aside at least six months of living expenses in case of job loss or other emergencies.
*   **Pay off high-interest debt:** Paying down debt like credit cards can provide a guaranteed, risk-free return equal to the interest rate you were paying.

**Other factors to consider:**
*   **Plan quality:** A 401k with high fees or poor investment options can negate the benefits of tax deferral.
*   **Your age and need for liquidity:** Younger individuals might benefit more from investing in their career or saving cash for a business or home, as 401k funds are locked up until retirement.
*   **Tax bracket:** If you are in a low tax bracket now, you might be better off paying taxes today and contributing to a Roth IRA/401k. A traditional 401k is generally better if your tax rate is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement.

*   **Re-allocate Now**: One viewpoint suggests selling the stocks, especially if the portfolio is lopsided (e.g., over 90% in one stock). The reasoning is that if you wouldn't buy that exact allocation with cash today, you shouldn't hold it. This reduces the risk of being over-exposed to a single company. However, you should consider the tax implications of selling.

*   **Balance Over Time**: Another approach is to leave your current holdings alone and buy other assets with new money until you reach your desired portfolio balance. This method avoids transaction costs and potential taxes from selling.

*   **Re-allocate Based on Performance**: A third strategy is to hold the stock as long as it is performing well and in an uptrend. You would only sell to re-allocate if technical analysis indicates the uptrend is ending and the price may begin to fall."
